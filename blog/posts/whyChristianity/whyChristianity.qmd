# Why Christianity?

Why should we believe Christianity over the plethora of other religions, or even atheism? Many in modern cultures believe the most rational position to hold on worldview is that complete neutrality, or believing in nothing by default is the best solution. However, if we have compelling evidence to the contrary, suggesting that there is a God, and that it's the Christian God, then it would be made obvious that those assumptions hold their own form of faith and bias.

No matter what we believe, we collectively struggle to answer questions of worldview about where we came from, why we're here, how we should behave while we're here, and what happens when we die. Why do we have these questions? Because we can't directly observe the origin of the universe, only the creator of the universe could tell us why we are here (unless there isn't one), only our creator could give us non-relativistic morality, and no one can report back their experience of death after experiencing it. So, we have a multitude of explanations for worldview, and we must ask which answers to those questions are correct. Fortunately, the Christian God has provided what I would call proof of his existence, and has proven that Christian scripture is inspired by Him. I think we can verify this by examining intelligent design, biblical history, biblical prophecy, and eye witness testimony.
