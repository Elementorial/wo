# Why Christianity?

Why should we believe Christianity over the plethora of other religions, or even atheism? Many in modern cultures believe the most rational position to hold on worldview is that complete neutrality, or believing in nothing by default is the best solution. However, if we have compelling evidence to the contrary, suggesting that there is a God, and that it's the Christian God, then it would be made obvious that those assumptions hold their own form of faith and bias.

No matter what we believe, we collectively struggle to answer questions of worldview about where we came from, why we're here, how we should behave while we're here, and what happens when we die. Why do we have these questions? Because we can't directly observe the origin of the universe; because only the creator of the universe could tell us why we are here (unless there isn't one); because only our creator could give us non-relativistic morality; and because no one can report back their experience of death after experiencing it. So, we have a multitude of explanations for worldview, and we must ask which answers to those questions are correct. Fortunately, the Christian God has provided evidence far beyond any reasonable doubt of His existence, and has proven that Christian scripture is inspired by Him. I think we can verify this by examining biblical history, biblical prophecy, and eye witness testimony.

Why do I choose these topics? History, supported by archaeology and historical documentation by historians (secular or not), agrees with the Biblical accounts. It also records the details of the fulfillment of biblical prophecy, and eyewitness testimony confirms this fulfillment. What you end up with are overlapping proofs. So, certain biblical events are historically recorded, even outside of the bible, while they also fulfill biblical prophecy, and are confirmed by eye witnesses to have happened.

## Biblical History

The Bible accurately records history. No point of secular history has contradicted its historical claims, and many points of speculation have been disproved.
- Belshazzar

Historical figures in old and new testament verified by archaeology. Archaeological verifications of biblical claims, revealed over time.

Scientific claims in the bible - constellations (binding of the Pleiades, loosing of the belts of Orion, etc.), paths in the sea, underwater springs.

Historical Jesus - Death under Pontius Pilate, empty tomb debate concedes that the tomb was empty.

The darkness and earthquakes surrounding Jesus's death. That the time of Jesus death (look for verification Mike talks about that the date of his death was historically recorded) was according to the lunar calendar of the passover, a denial that an eclipse was possible. The earthquake that was recorded to have caused temple damage in 33 A.D. could explain how the veil was torn.

Other support such as undesigned coincidences. Charles Leslie's framework suggesting that Jewish history and Jesus's resurrection celebrations set up ongoing tradition based on public events that couldn't have been made up later. You wouldn't convince the Jews that their history is fake because they have a record of their history and the continued occasions made to remember them.

## Eye witness testimony

Disciples testimony and their spreading of the gospel even unto torture and death at the hands of persecutors. They claimed locally and soon after the fact that many had seen the risen Christ.

Evidence for the empty tomb, and the risen Christ.

## Prophecy

Historical prophecies that we have no reason to believe were written after they happened and have historical verification of - Tyre, Cyrus, etc.

Prophecy of Daniel - kingdoms of the statue of 4 metals, their fulfillment, Josephus's recognition of this fulfillment. Jesus mentions it and how he would fulfill the prophecy about the son of man by being "cut off", and also confirms that the temple would be destroyed after this, as we know happened in 70 A.D. We know these things happen in the years predicted by Daniel, and the dates of these prophecies are confirmed to be before many of the events happened because of the dead sea scrolls.

Prophecies about Jesus - Psalm 22, Isaiah 52 and 53. We know these were written before Jesus was born. Some details, such as those about the crucifixion, could not have been written into the Bible to in order fulfill the prophecy, because they are verifiable as expected events for that time in history, such as casting of lots for His clothes, the piercing of hands and feet of crucifixion victims, that crucifixion was a public spectacle. And this couldn't have just been made up to fulfill prophecy because Jesus's crucifixion is recorded as historical.  <Prophecies that Jesus fulfilled video>

Prophecies fulfilled about Israel - that they would separate and rejoin; they rejoined as an official nation in 1948 after how long?
