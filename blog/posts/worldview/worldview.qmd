## Worldview

&emsp;Most people would simultaneously like and scoff at the idea of one source which could accurately inform our worldview about our origin, tell us why we exist and what our purpose is, show us correct morality, and tell us what our destiny will be.

#### A basis for reality

&emsp;Anyone who cares about finding the truth looks to determine the answers to these questions; they are summed up in the terms "Origin, meaning, morality, and destiny." which I first heard from the late Ravi Zacharias.

&emsp;Our understanding of our meaning and purpose must come from a foundation which is solid - a rock, so to speak. Otherwise, when your worldview crumbles because it was built on sand, your beliefs about who you are crumble with it because you are a part of reality. In trials (moments when your character is tested), realizing that you don't understand reality itself makes it harder to understand which actions to take because you don't have a purpose to motivate your decisions. Needless to say, building an accurate worldview sounds like an imposing task; perhaps that's why many people neglect building one, deciding that their own will and desires suffice as a purpose to live for.

#### Where is truth?

&emsp;Many wish to prevent people from thinking for themselves. The world has us believe we can know nothing on our own, since we are ignorant and finite. It also indoctrinates us into believing that the only way one can ever know anything is by accepting what is understood within the world, daring you to question its dogma. Sure, the world may allow you to believe in a religion, but it may only be cultural, and any assertions about reality which would even passively point to objective morality are considered evil. Moral relativism has caused many to believe that no one may know right from wrong. Many accept this message out of humility for their own ignorance - humility normally being a good thing, until some seek to take advantage of one who is giving them the benefit of the doubt. Not everyone seeks the Word of God, because it exposes evil for what it is. This is why you're not allowed to speak the truth in the Word to the world. You are also not allowed to make any certain statement outside of science; science cannot dictate morality and is therefore also allowed by the world to be shared. However, the Word exposes evil and the lies which enable it, showing us the complete goodness and love of God himself, the perfect one. Needless to say, those who aren't willing to repent will resent the conviction that his moral perfection brings.

&emsp;I would argue that the answers we need to be able to understand truth were given to us by our creator. We're not sifting through chaos, determining truth through our own strength; not even everyone together can comprehend reality completely and/or accurately. Our creator does not leave us to determine truth about reality and ourselves on our own (again, not that we could). He is loving to have provided answers to our deepest questions about each of the topics of worldview through His Word as no other source can.

#### The response to truth

><r r="1 John 1 5">This is the message which we have heard from him and announce to you, that God is light, and in him is no darkness at all. (1 John 1:5)</r>

&emsp;God's word shows us how good He is; when we see His goodness, we see how much we fall short of it, and how evil our hearts truly are. We should be drawn to this goodness; however, imagine the offense many people take when this light which exposes evil is turned onto them, exposing them for who they are. Pride may cause them to remain in the dark, covering their evil. This pride will keep them from understanding the solution to their plight; the God who created everything knows what is good and evil, and is also just. Evil must be punished by a just God, and all have sinned<r c="ro 3 23">@Romans_3:23</r>. This justice for evil is good, but we each are responsible for our own evil deeds, and we should receive the wrath of God which they bring. The only way for us to not receive this punishment is for another who doesn't deserve this wrath to accept it for us, as a sacrifice. The Bible tells us of the one who made this sacrifice for us. The son of God gave his life to provide the atonement for those who put their faith in God.

><r r="John 3 16 17">For God so loved the world, that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish, but have eternal life. For God didn't send his Son into the world to judge the world, but that the world should be saved through him. (John 3:16-17)</r>

&emsp;The Bible tells us the story of reality in the words of the one who created it, so when we know that it is reliable, we can trust it to inform our worldview. The word tells us the historical details about origin and history, tells us why we were created, shows us correct morality in love, and tells us what our destiny will be. The promises of God are worth searching for in the Bible. From it, you can learn that you have nothing to lose and everything to gain if only you give your life to God as a living sacrifice, which is the only proper response to the ultimate gift which has been offered to us<r c="ro 12 1">@Romans_12:1</r>. The result of our faith is that we become new creations<r c="2 Corinthians 5 17">@2_Corinthians_5:17</r>, co-heirs with Christ in the familial kingdom of God<r c="Romans 8 16 17">@Romans_8:16-17</r>, and gain eternal life<r c="jn 3 16">@John_3:16</r>.
