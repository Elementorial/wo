<h1>Old Testament Salvation</h1>
<p> Someone once mentioned an idea to me — that people who had died before Jesus made His life sacrifice couldn’t have been saved. This idea has always troubled me since Christians say our faith in Christ’s work is what saves us from wrath. I wondered whether God had somehow left the people in the Old Testament out of the salvation of Christ. How could God seem to say, “I simply couldn’t save you in time through faith alone.”, if he is all powerful? Were these people in the Old Testament saved by following the law, then? Paul will speak against this.</p>
<section id="christ-from-the-beginning" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="christ-from-the-beginning">Christ from the beginning</h2>
<p>We know Christ existed before any human because he existed before the world. We know this because He says,</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p><r r="John 17 5">Now, Father, glorify me with your own self with the glory which I had with you before the world existed. (John 17:5)</r></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Because Jesus existed before the world, God’s salvation through faith in his redemptive power was available to everyone who could need it; people just didn’t know that Christ was the messiah until He had shown himself to be. We also see people in the Old Testament put their faith in God, believing that He would not leave them unredeemed:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p><r r="ps 16 10 11">For you will not leave my soul in Sheol, Neither will you allow your holy one to see corruption. You will show me the path of life. In your presence is fullness of joy. In your right hand there are pleasures forevermore. (Psalms 16:10-11)</r></p>
</blockquote>
</section>
<section id="abraham-was-justified-through-faith" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="abraham-was-justified-through-faith">Abraham was justified through faith</h2>
<p> Abraham’s faith was counted as righteousness in Romans 4:3, which references Genesis 15:6<r c="gn 15 6"><span class="citation" data-cites="Genesis_15:6"><sup><a href="#ref-Genesis_15:6" role="doc-biblioref">1</a></sup></span></r>:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p><r r="ro 4 3">For what does the Scripture say? “Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him for righteousness.” (Romans 4:3)</r></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Romans 4:6-8 also references Psalm 32:1-2<r c="ps 32 1 2"><span class="citation" data-cites="Psalms_32:1-2"><sup><a href="#ref-Psalms_32:1-2" role="doc-biblioref">2</a></sup></span></r> in saying,</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p><r r="ro 4 6 8">Even as David also pronounces blessing on the man to whom God counts righteousness apart from works, “Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven, Whose sins are covered. Blessed is the man whom the Lord will by no means charge with sin.” (Romans 4:6-8)</r></p>
</blockquote>
<p>These verses from Psalm are important because they were written long before Christ came into the world, yet they show that Abraham was still counted as righteous through faith. We can see it was through his faith that he was saved. So, what was his faith in?</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p><r r="ro 4 13">For the promise to Abraham and to his seed that he should be heir of the world wasn’t through the law, but through the righteousness of faith. (Romans 4:13)</r></p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, his faith was in God’s promise, and the promise was that the seed of Abraham, “He” (Christ), would be heir of the world. We also see clarification that the promise itself is specifically to Christ:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p><r r="ga 3 16">Now the promises were spoken to Abraham and to his seed. He doesn’t say, “To seeds,” as of many, but as of one, “To your seed,” which is Christ. (Galatians 3:16)</r></p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p> Before continuing, I wanted to address these references to the seed of Abraham. I was confused because Paul says the word ‘seed’ in Genesis is singular to refer to Jesus. However, it’s used in the plural in some translations. This led me to research what exactly he meant because some people see that the translation to a plural word, often as “descendants”, is contradictory to what Paul says in Galatians 3 about the term being singular. I’ve heard that the word for seed is interpretable as both singular and plural in Hebrew and Greek, similar to English, and it seems Paul recognized the double meaning of this word somewhere. There are several references to the seed of Abraham<r c="gn 12 7, gn 13 15 16, gn 15 5, gn 22 18, gn 26 3 4, gn 28 13 14"><span class="citation" data-cites="Genesis_12:7 Genesis_13:15-16 Genesis_15:5 Genesis_22:18 Genesis_26:3-4 Genesis_28:13-14"><sup><a href="#ref-Genesis_12:7" role="doc-biblioref">3</a>–<a href="#ref-Genesis_28:13-14" role="doc-biblioref">8</a></sup></span></r>, but from the phrasing, Paul seems to be referencing,</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p><r r=" gn 22 18">In your seed will all the nations of the earth be blessed, because you have obeyed my voice.” (Genesis 22:18)</r></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s clear here that the singular tense is possible, and this seems to be the underlying meaning that Paul is sharing. Translations using “offspring” keep the possible singularity as well; however, others translate it as “descendants”. This loses the singular meaning that Paul was sharing about.</p>
<hr>
<p> Justification was possible before Christ because the promise given to Abraham was Christ, who has existed from the beginning. This means God’s promise of salvation through faith was always available through faith in Him. Anyone who put their faith in God for their redemption even before Christ’s death were putting their faith in Christ. How? The promise of the seed which is Christ was given to Abraham and his seed (children of faith), and so by putting their faith in that promise (or God’s redemption of themselves), they were putting their faith in Christ because God and Christ are one. The promise was one of the fulfillment of Christ’s work; He offered it to be accepted by faith in Him, and God could do this since Christ is God, so God knew Christ would fulfill the promise of His sacrifice.</p>
</section>
<section id="we-are-made-children-of-abraham-through-faith" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="we-are-made-children-of-abraham-through-faith">We are made children of Abraham through faith</h2>
<p> Paul shows us that this promise is extended to all those who are of faith, and that their faith makes them children of Abraham.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p><r r="ga 3 6 9">Even as Abraham “believed God, and it was counted to him for righteousness.” Know therefore that those who are of faith, the same are children of Abraham. The Scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the Gentiles by faith, preached the Gospel beforehand to Abraham, saying, “In you all the nations will be blessed.” So then, those who are of faith are blessed with the faithful Abraham. (Galatians 3:6-9)</r></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Paul is relating these ideas of faith justifying Abraham, and also his offspring’s (seed’s, or believers’) ability to be justified through faith. He’s saying it was through Christ’s power to justify that the promise to Abraham about his descendants would be fulfilled. To be one of the seeds of Abraham, you must simply have faith that God will redeem you from sin (through Christ, as we now know), and you inherit the promise of the kingdom. Romans says we’re then co-heirs with Christ in this kingdom.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p><r r="ro 8 16 17">The Spirit himself testifies with our spirit that we are children of God; and if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ; if indeed we suffer with him, that we may also be glorified with him. (Romans 8:16-17)</r></p>
</blockquote>
</section>
<section id="justification-is-not-of-the-law" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="justification-is-not-of-the-law">Justification is not of the law</h2>
<p> After noting that the seed of the promise is Christ, Paul continues, clarifying that this promise of Christ’s inheritance came before the law, and is not of the law, meaning the law doesn’t justify us.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p><r r="ga 3 17 18">Now I say this. A covenant confirmed beforehand by God in Christ, the law, which came four hundred thirty years after, does not annul, so as to make the promise of no effect. For if the inheritance is of the law, it is no more of promise; but God has granted it to Abraham by promise. (Galatians 3:17-18)</r></p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, we know the justification of Old Testament believers didn’t come from following the law. Also, Abraham existed before the law was even given. Paul also says the law does not invalidate this covenant of salvation through Christ. Perhaps he says this because some would wonder how Christ could free them from the law. However, Paul understands that this promise of Christ came well before the law, and the law cannot invalidate that promise which existed from the beginning. In fact, the law was given in order to bring our attention to this promise of Christ and assure us of our need for Him, since none of us could follow the law. The law should drive us to put our faith in Christ for our salvation:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p><r r="ga 3 24 27">So that the law has become our tutor to bring us to Christ, that we might be justified by faith. But now that faith has come, we are no longer under a tutor. For you are all children of God, through faith in Christ Jesus. For as many of you as were baptized into Christ have put on Christ. (Galatians 3:24-27)</r></p>
</blockquote>
</section>
<section id="the-blessing-of-many-nations-a-sprinkling-from-christ" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-blessing-of-many-nations-a-sprinkling-from-christ">The blessing of many nations, a sprinkling from Christ</h2>
<p> God’s promise to Abraham was that Christ would bless all the nations of the Earth, and we know that He did this through Christ’s life and blood sacrifice which was to pay for the sin of those who put their faith in Him. This messiah, who is Christ, was prophesied about as well; Christ’s blessing of many nations is here prophesied to be His sprinkling of many nations,</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p><r r="is 52 15">so shall he sprinkle many nations; kings shall shut their mouths at him: for that which had not been told them shall they see; and that which they had not heard shall they understand. (Isaiah 52:15)</r></p>
</blockquote>
<p>which is signaled in the Old Testament with the sprinkling of the blood of animal sacrifices, which pointed forward to Christ.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p><r r="le 16 15 16">“Then he shall kill the goat of the sin offering, that is for the people, and bring his blood within the veil, and do with his blood as he did with the blood of the bull, and sprinkle it on the mercy seat, and before the mercy seat: and he shall make atonement for the Holy Place, because of the uncleanness of the children of Israel, and because of their transgressions, even all their sins; and so he shall do for the Tent of Meeting, that dwells with them in the midst of their uncleanness. (Leviticus 16:15-16)</r></p>
</blockquote>
<p>God’s promise that many nations would be blessed in Abraham’s seed was fulfilled in Christ’s sacrifice on the cross. His blood was the payment offered for our sins, and we receive this offering through faith. This promise of our justification to God through faith was offered before Christ was even born on the Earth, and it creates God’s spiritual family, the so-called children of Abraham. Jesus existed before the world existed, so God’s promise of redemption existed for every person to put their faith in, though it still had to be physically fulfilled. It was prophesied of, and we know it was fulfilled in history; we see our God is true to His word.</p>
