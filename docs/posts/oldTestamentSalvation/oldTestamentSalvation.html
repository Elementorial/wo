<p><strong>Review and rewrite</strong> <strong>Change NASB references to be generated</strong></p>
<p>Prerequisites: The Law, salvation by grace through faith, the trinity from the beginning, the Promise to Abraham which is the seed which is Christ, and generally ‘Promises to Abraham’. Someone suggested to me that since people in the Old Testament didn’t know Jesus, they couldn’t possibly be saved. This idea has always troubled me. I wondered whether God had somehow left the people in the old testament out of the salvation of Christ. How could God essentially say, “I simply couldn’t save you in time through faith alone.” if he is all powerful? Were these people in the OT saved by the law, then? Paul will speak against this. I had said at the meeting that we know Jesus existed from the beginning of Time because God says “Let us create man…”. This makes God plural, meaning the trinity existed from the beginning. Because Jesus existed from the beginning of time, his promise was always there to put faith for salvation in, the people just didn’t know who he was until he came. I gave the example of Abraham’s faith being counted as righteousness in Romans 4:3. Romans 4:6-8 also references Psalm 32:1-2 in saying, “And David speaks likewise of the blessedness of the man to whom God credits righteousness apart from works: ‘Blessed are they whose lawless acts are forgiven, whose sins are covered. Blessed is the man whose sin the Lord will never count against him.’” These verses from Psalm are important because they come long before Christ, yet they show that Abraham was still counted as righteous. How could this be? Abraham wasn’t saved by the law since he was before the law. It was through his faith. There were two topics related to our discussion which go hand in hand in Galatians 3 which I believe God brought to my mind; In Galatians 3, these two topics are salvation by faith in the seed which is Christ (The seed being the subject of focus), and also that our salvation comes only and completely from faith in Christ. Perhaps I should also remind her of the concept of being saved by grace through faith alone before this if I get to talk to her since it’s related to old testament law, and the law did not save, but pointed us to salvation. Both ideas of salvation by faith alone and Christ the seed are mentioned here when Paul says in Galatians 3:18, “For if the inheritance is based on law, it is no longer based on a promise; but God has granted it to Abraham by means of a promise.” So, what is that promise? I was reminded of the concept of the promise of the seed in Galatians 3, and had to go revisit it because the promise is referring to Jesus, who is older than the old testament since he is God. Backing up a couple verses, 16-17 say, “Now the promises were spoken to Abraham and to his seed. He does not say, ‘And to seeds,’ as referring to many, but rather to one, ‘And to your seed,’ that is, Christ. What I am saying is this: the Law, which came four hundred and thirty years later, does not invalidate a covenant previously ratified by God, so as to nullify the promise.” These verses are related to salvation before Christ because they’re saying the promise given to Abraham was Christ, who has existed from the beginning. This reaffirms my statement that his salvation through faith was always available. Anyone who put their faith in God for their salvation even before Christ’s death were putting their faith in Christ. How? The promise of the seed which is Christ was given to Abraham and his descendants, and so by putting their faith in that promise, they were putting their faith in Christ because God and Jesus are separate but one in the Trinity. The promise was one of the fulfillment of Christ’s purpose, and He offered it to be accepted by faith in Him, and God could do this since Christ is God, so God knew Christ would fulfill the promise of his sacrifice. Paul also says the law does not invalidate this covenant of salvation through Christ. Perhaps he says this because some would wonder how Christ could free us from the law. However, Paul understands that this promise of Christ came well before the law, and the law cannot invalidate that promise. In fact, the law was to bring our attention to this promise of Christ and assure us of our need for Him. The law should drive us to put our faith in Christ for our salvation. Before continuing, I wanted to address these references to the seed of Abraham. I was troubled because Paul says the word ‘seed’ in Genesis is singular to refer to Jesus, but it’s used in the plural in the references. This led me to research what exactly he meant because some people see this as a blatant contradiction. The seed is referenced in several places. One reference is in Genesis 12:7, KJV, “And the LORD appeared unto Abram, and said, Unto thy seed will I give this land: and there builded he an altar unto the LORD, who appeared unto him.” Galatians 3:6-9 say, “Even so Abraham BELIEVED GOD, AND IT WAS RECKONED TO HIM AS RIGHTEOUSNESS. Therefore, be sure that it is those who are of faith who are sons of Abraham. The Scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the Gentiles by faith, preached the gospel beforehand to Abraham, saying, “ALL THE NATIONS WILL BE BLESSED IN YOU.” So then those who are of faith are blessed with Abraham, the believer.” He’s relating these ideas of faith justifying Abraham, and also his descendants’(seed’s) ability to be justified through faith. The word for descendants is “seed” in Hebrew, and the KJV translates this correctly, however others translate it as descendants, offspring, etc. This however loses the dual meaning of the word seed which Paul has realized and was sharing. Paul asserts that the seed is also singularly referring to Christ. So the promise to Abraham is the seed which is Christ, and this promise goes to the seeds which are Abraham’s descendants. Less abstractly, God gives a promise of Christ’s salvation to Abraham, which is presented as a metaphor of a seed because Christ will create God’s spiritual family; this spiritual family is also represented as the seeds of Abraham. Jesus existed from the beginning of time and his purpose was always known, so his promise always existed, and could be accepted from the beginning of time though it still had to be physically fulfilled <strong>Mention Abraham’s bosom</strong>. This promise which Paul speaks of is the inheritance of Abraham. God made many promises to Abraham, but one of them was justification by faith. How do we know justification through faith was promised to Abraham? Because of Galatians 3:9 above, and Romans 4:13, “For the promise to Abraham or to his descendants that he would be heir of the world was not through the Law, but through the righteousness of faith.” Paul is saying it was through Christ’s salvation that the promise to Abraham about his descendants would be fulfilled. It was through a spiritual inheritance in Christ that God’s promises to Abraham would be fulfilled, including their inheritance of the land, which I interpret in this context to mean God will build a kingdom through Christ. To be one of the seeds of Abraham, you must simply have faith, and you inherit the promise.</p>
