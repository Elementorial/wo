<p> Confession and repentance are perhaps two of the first things people do when they come to faith in Christ. The first step in restoring our relationship with God is to recognize how evil our sin is, and how it affects our relationship with God, who is personal. When we confess our sins to God, then we receive the grace He is willing to give to us out of His goodness, and are forgiven<r c="1 John 1 9"><span class="citation" data-cites="1_John_1:9"><sup><a href="#ref-1_John_1:9" role="doc-biblioref">1</a></sup></span></r>. This is a part of love, which God teaches us through His Word. We are now to forgive as He has forgiven us<r c="Colossians 3 13"><span class="citation" data-cites="Colossians_3:13"><sup><a href="#ref-Colossians_3:13" role="doc-biblioref">2</a></sup></span></r>. It’s important then that we seek to understand the true process of restoring relationships so we can understand how our relationships are to be restored to God, and to each other.</p>
<section id="whats-the-purpose-of-this-article" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="whats-the-purpose-of-this-article">What’s the purpose of this article?</h2>
<p> I believe the common connotations of what repentance, confession, and forgiveness mean often miss some biblical points, and are easily twisted to mean different things and to get certain results in relationships. The biblical denotations are important to understand; otherwise there will be confusion when reading the Bible, which is one of Christian’s sources of truth. I’ll give a definition for each of these terms. After establishing this baseline understanding to work from, then they can be applied alongside one another to build a more complete picture of God’s plan to restore relationships; so, once the terms are defined, I’ll give a biblical defense of the definitions, and then I’ll attempt to address some misunderstandings of and between the terms, and give examples of the terms in use.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="define-repentance">Define repentance</h3>
<p> Repentance in the Bible means to change one’s mind, in the sense of inverting an intent, or action. The word is often used to express this inversion in the presence of regret, though repentance itself isn’t inherently tied to the feeling of regret, or the taking of different actions; it indicates an intellectual inversion. It’s used to command that people change their mind about their relationship with God. It’s also used to call people to change their mind about Christ Himself, and to accept Him as their redeemer.</p>

<section id="repentance-defending-the-definition" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="repentance-defending-the-definition">Repentance — defending the definition</h3>
<p> The point that repentance is simply an intellectual operation comes more from a lack of evidence in the Bible to the contrary. There’s often debate that repentance means “turning from sin”, and that as such it can’t simply be an intellectual operation. In the interest of keeping the definition poignant, this debate will be explained more in a later section; this is partially because I think it’s mostly a semantics issue. It should suffice for now to say, I believe both that repenting is intellectual, and that Christians are called to “turn from sin”.</p>
<p> That repentance is turning toward God is seen in,</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">

</blockquote>
<p>Repentance as changing one’s mind about Christ is seen in this section, which deserves its own article due to its complexity of interpretations <a href="Link to acts 2:38 article"></a>:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p><r r="ac 2 36 39">“Let all the house of Israel therefore know assuredly that God has made him both Lord and Christ, this Jesus whom you crucified.” Now when they heard this, they were cut to the heart, and said to Peter and the rest of the apostles, “Brothers, what shall we do?” Peter said to them, “Repent, and be baptized, everyone of you, in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of sins, and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. For to you is the promise, and to your children, and to all who are far off, even as many as the Lord our God will call to himself.” (Acts 2:36-39)</r></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Repentance in the sense of changing one’s mind about having taken an action (“sorry”, or “change of mind”, in some translations):</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p><r r="gn 6 6">Yahweh was sorry that he had made man on the earth, and it grieved him in his heart. (Genesis 6:6)</r></p>
<p><r r="ex 13 17">It happened, when Pharaoh had let the people go, that God didn’t lead them by the way of the land of the Philistines, although that was near; for God said, “Lest perhaps the people change their minds when they see war, and they return to Egypt;” (Exodus 13:17)</r></p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="define-confession">Define confession</h3>
<p> Biblical confession is the act of admitting, after a conviction in oneself, that one has sinned (done what is evil in God’s sight), that this sin has damaged the relationship between the involved parties, that this sin requires the wrath of God to be satisfied against it, and finally that God will show His grace and mercy to those who put their faith in Him by redeeming them. Biblical confession is, in its fullness, both a confession of sin and confession of faith in Christ as one’s redeemer; one’s placement of faith in Christ as one’s redeemer functions implicitly as a confession of sin, since putting faith in a redeemer means one has sin to be redeemed from.</p>

<section id="confession-defending-the-definition" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="confession-defending-the-definition">Confession — defending the definition</h3>
<p> Sin damages relationships. God knows our hearts, and our deeds, and there’s a reason those who have sinned and are unclean are not allowed to be in relationship with God. The body of Christ, made of believers, is to be joined as one with Him; an example of this oneness can be seen in Christ as the head, and believers as His body in Ephesians 4<r c="ep 4 14 16"><span class="citation" data-cites="Ephesians_4:14-16"><sup><a href="#ref-Ephesians_4:14-16" role="doc-biblioref">3</a></sup></span></r> and 5<r c="ep 5 23"><span class="citation" data-cites="Ephesians_5:23"><sup><a href="#ref-Ephesians_5:23" role="doc-biblioref">4</a></sup></span></r>. Would the perfect God ever sin<r c="1 jn 1 5"><span class="citation" data-cites="1_John_1:5"><sup><a href="#ref-1_John_1:5" role="doc-biblioref">5</a></sup></span></r>? No, so how could he be joined as one in body with sinners? He can’t be, because He would never be evil, which He would be if the part of Him that was made one with Him was tainted. The fact that confession of sin is necessary before God’s forgiveness,</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p><r r="1 jn 1 9">If we confess our sins, he is faithful and righteous to forgive us the sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness. (1 John 1:9)</r></p>
</blockquote>
<p>and that God’s wrath, resulting in the second death<r c="re 21 8"><span class="citation" data-cites="Revelation_21:8"><sup><a href="#ref-Revelation_21:8" role="doc-biblioref">6</a></sup></span></r>, is a necessary consequence of sin<r c="ro 1 18"><span class="citation" data-cites="Romans_1:18"><sup><a href="#ref-Romans_1:18" role="doc-biblioref">7</a></sup></span></r> also shows that relationship is damaged by sin. If God hadn’t offered us justification then we would all have been apart from Him forever, and this is how we know that sin damages relationships. The final point that God will show His grace and mercy to those who put their faith in Him for their redemption has so many references in the Word that I don’t know where to start in citing them. The entire Word points toward Jesus as our redeemer. Perhaps I should quote the oft-cited:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">

<section id="define-forgiveness" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="define-forgiveness">Define forgiveness</h3>
<p> Biblical forgiveness is the act of considering a debt in a given relationship — that exists because of sin, and is therefore unpayable by the sinner — as having been paid off, in response to a confession of sin, with the understanding that Christ makes this forgiveness possible; this forgiveness is done in order to restore the relationship, which ought not exist otherwise. Christians recognize that their forgiveness of others is simply a mirroring of God’s forgiveness of their own sin, which He gives to those who put their faith in Him for their salvation (from His righteous wrath against this sin) — this salvation coming through the blood and life sacrifice of Jesus Christ.</p>

<section id="forgiveness-defending-the-definition" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="forgiveness-defending-the-definition">Forgiveness — defending the definition</h3>
<p> From the section above on confession, we should understand from Colossians 3:13<r c="co 3 13"><span class="citation" data-cites="Colossians_3:13"><sup><a href="#ref-Colossians_3:13" role="doc-biblioref">2</a></sup></span></r> and 1 John 1:9<r c="1 jn 1 9"><span class="citation" data-cites="1_John_1:9"><sup><a href="#ref-1_John_1:9" role="doc-biblioref">1</a></sup></span></r> that we’re to forgive when we’re confessed to, just as God as done for us. Part of The Lord’s Prayer asks that the Lord forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors<r c="Matthew 6 12"><span class="citation" data-cites="Matthew_6:12"><sup><a href="#ref-Matthew_6:12" role="doc-biblioref">8</a></sup></span></r>. Our “debts” to God in this case would be from sin and not monetary debt, and other places in the Bible call sin a debt and refer to it with financial analogies. There’s a parable at the end of Matthew 18 which, while being about forgiving sin, uses the example of a debt:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p><r r="Matthew 18 21 35">Then Peter came and said to him, “Lord, how often shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? Until seven times?” Jesus said to him, “I don’t tell you until seven times, but, until seventy times seven. Therefore the Kingdom of Heaven is like a certain king, who wanted to reconcile accounts with his servants. When he had begun to reconcile, one was brought to him who owed him ten thousand talents.{Ten thousand talents represents an extremely large sum of money, equivalent to about 60,000,000 denarii, where one denarius was typical of one day’s wages for agricultural labor.} But because he couldn’t pay, his lord commanded him to be sold, with his wife, his children, and all that he had, and payment to be made. The servant therefore fell down and kneeled before him, saying, ‘Lord, have patience with me, and I will repay you all!’ The lord of that servant, being moved with compassion, released him, and forgave him the debt.”But that servant went out, and found one of his fellow servants, who owed him one hundred denarii,{100 denarii was about one sixtieth of a talent.} and he grabbed him, and took him by the throat, saying, ‘Pay me what you owe!’ “So his fellow servant fell down at his feet and begged him, saying, ‘Have patience with me, and I will repay you!’ He would not, but went and cast him into prison, until he should pay back that which was due. So when his fellow servants saw what was done, they were exceedingly sorry, and came and told to their lord all that was done. Then his lord called him in, and said to him, ‘You wicked servant! I forgave you all that debt, because you begged me. Shouldn’t you also have had mercy on your fellow servant, even as I had mercy on you?’ His lord was angry, and delivered him to the tormentors, until he should pay all that was due to him. So my heavenly Father will also do to you, if you don’t each forgive your brother from your hearts for his misdeeds.” (Matthew 18:21-35)</r></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Christ is the sacrifice that God has given to put one’s faith in to receive the remission of one’s sin<r c="ac 2 38"><span class="citation" data-cites="Acts_2:38"><sup><a href="#ref-Acts_2:38" role="doc-biblioref">9</a></sup></span></r> — where remission means, “payment for” (as in “remit”), and implies that the result of this payment is our forgiveness which eliminates the wrath in store for us from God. The above parable draws our attention to the fact that if we refuse to forgive others in the same manner that God has forgiven us after having recognized the payment that resulted in our forgiveness, then we forfeit our own forgiveness. Again, if we’re to forgive in like manner to God, then we forgive when and only when confessed to<r c="mt 18 15 17, lk 17 3 4"><span class="citation" data-cites="Matthew_18:15-17 Luke_17:3-4"><sup><a href="#ref-Matthew_18:15-17" role="doc-biblioref">10</a>,<a href="#ref-Luke_17:3-4" role="doc-biblioref">11</a></sup></span></r>, while recognizing that it’s not us who has made the forgiveness possible — Christ has<r c="jn 3 16"><span class="citation" data-cites="John_3:16"><sup><a href="#ref-John_3:16" role="doc-biblioref">12</a></sup></span></r>.

<p> It should be noted that, while these terms are defined and explained separately, they are inseparable from the proper response to God’s Word. So, when it seems that they are tied together in the Bible, it’s because they are tied together in reality. Repentance and confession are both stated as prerequisites to forgiveness<r c="1 jn 1 9, lk 17 3 4"><span class="citation" data-cites="1_John_1:9 Luke_17:3-4"><sup><a href="#ref-1_John_1:9" role="doc-biblioref">1</a>,<a href="#ref-Luke_17:3-4" role="doc-biblioref">11</a></sup></span></r>.

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="repentance-in-practice-and-in-context">Repentance — in practice and in context</h3>
<p> I mentioned that repentance can function as a sort of confession to God. I’ve seen “repentance” generally used in place of “confession”, especially in spheres that relegate confession to the Catholic sense of the term. Other times, repentance is seen as an apology or expression of remorse for an action, similar to what confession is supposed to be. It appears that repentance as a change of mind can function as confession for sin to family in Christ when repentance is explicitly stated<r c="lk 17 3 4"><span class="citation" data-cites="Luke_17:3-4"><sup><a href="#ref-Luke_17:3-4" role="doc-biblioref">11</a></sup></span></r>.</p>
<p> Repentance is used in the Bible to command changing one’s mind about God and Christ, which means putting our faith in Christ for our justification with God. This necessitates also the will to turn one’s mind and actions from evil<r c="ro 6 1 2"><span class="citation" data-cites="Romans_6:1-2"><sup><a href="#ref-Romans_6:1-2" role="doc-biblioref">14</a></sup></span></r>, though repentance itself isn’t synonymous with such actions since it’s strictly a change of mind. This association seems to be what prompts people to believe repentance it itself turning to Christ or away from sin, but ascribing this meaning to it so that it’s implicit with the use of the word has contributed to much confusion about biblical interpretation.</p>

<section id="repentance-is-a-change-of-mind" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="repentance-is-a-change-of-mind">Repentance is a change of mind</h4>
<p> When repentance is used, it’s often interpreted as “turning from sin”, in the sense of engaging in a continual attempt to sin no more. “Repent of sins”, “repent for sins”, and other similar phrasings aren’t in the Bible, so this common belief needs to be challenged. The argument that repentance is “turning from sins” usually suggests that its proximity to calls for refraining from evil deeds would indicate this meaning. However, one could also argue that this proximity would indicate a distinctly separate meaning that requires separate clarification to turn from evil; this would be the case if it’s strictly a change of mind. Where I’ve seen “repentance” used in close proximity to calls to turn from evil,</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p><r r="ezk 14 6">Therefore tell the house of Israel, Thus says the Lord Yahweh: Return you, and turn yourselves from your idols; and turn away your faces from all your abominations. (Ezekiel 14:6)</r></p>
<p><r r="ezk 18 30">Therefore I will judge you, house of Israel, everyone according to his ways, says the Lord Yahweh. Return you, and turn yourselves from all your transgressions; so iniquity shall not be your ruin. (Ezekiel 18:30)</r></p>
</blockquote>
<p>it’s also used in a conjunctive form, which is why its translated, “Repent, and …”, or “Return you, and …” in some translations. This would support the idea that repentance is different from “turning from transgression”, and that the two actions complement each other.</p>
<p> “Turning from sin” may also be interpreted as meaning that when you receive the Holy Spirit, you receive the power to actually never sin again. While Christians are called to righteous living<r c="ro 6 15"><span class="citation" data-cites="Romans_6:15"><sup><a href="#ref-Romans_6:15" role="doc-biblioref">15</a></sup></span></r>, we’re also expected to confess our sins, such as when following the Lord’s prayer<r c="mt 6 12"><span class="citation" data-cites="Matthew_6:12"><sup><a href="#ref-Matthew_6:12" role="doc-biblioref">8</a></sup></span></r>, or to family in Christ<r c="mt 18 15 17, lk 17 3 4"><span class="citation" data-cites="Matthew_18:15-17 Luke_17:3-4"><sup><a href="#ref-Matthew_18:15-17" role="doc-biblioref">10</a>,<a href="#ref-Luke_17:3-4" role="doc-biblioref">11</a></sup></span></r>. Therefore, it should be clear that Christians aren’t yet perfected in righteousness. I believe another couple relevant passages to the topic are:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p><r r="1 jn 1 9 10, 1 jn 2 1 2">If we confess our sins, he is faithful and righteous to forgive us the sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness. If we say that we haven’t sinned, we make him a liar, and his word is not in us. (1 John 1:9-10); My little children, I write these things to you so that you may not sin. If anyone sins, we have a Counselor{Greek Parakleton: Counselor, Helper, Intercessor, Advocate, and Comfortor.} with the Father, Jesus Christ, the righteous. And he is the atoning sacrifice{“atoning sacrifice” is from the Greek “hilasmos,” an appeasing, propitiating, or the means of appeasement or propitiation– the sacrifice that turns away God’s wrath because of our sin.} for our sins, and not for ours only, but also for the whole world. (1 John 2:1-2)</r></p>
</blockquote>
<p> Perhaps the strongest proof that repentance is not turning from sins in general, but is a change of mind, comes from the verses that say God has repented. It becomes clear when we understand that God can have no sins to turn from that “repent” doesn’t strictly mean “turning from sins in general”. There are many verses where God is said to have repented. One is,</p>

<p><r r="ex 32 14">Yahweh repented of the evil which he said he would do to his people. (Exodus 32:14)</r></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Notice the phrasing, “repented of”, and that God can’t sin; this phrasing should be understood to establish that “repenting of” something is simply changing ones mind about it. This phrasing is found in another verse that is often used to defend the idea that repenting is for sin (in the sense that repentance is turning from sin, rather than only a change of mind).</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p><r r="ac 8 22">Repent therefore of this, your wickedness, and ask God if perhaps the thought of your heart may be forgiven you. (Acts 8:22)</r></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Since we know God can’t turn from sin (since he has none), the same phrasing “repented of” here means the person is to change his mind. Here, a man named Simon is being told to change his mind about believing that the gift of the power of God could be bought with money. This change of beliefs should change his actions, but his “repentance” itself was not dependant on those actions, which I say to make the point that the repentance is not the physical act or effort of turning from those actions. This concept is important because it shows that our repentance toward God and Christ is not by our actions, but is by our belief, though our actions are expected to follow suit in submission to Christ.</p>
<p> It should be noted that Simon was in previous verses said to have had faith,</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p><r r="ac 8 13">Simon himself also believed. Being baptized, he continued with Philip. Seeing signs and great miracles occuring, he was amazed. (Acts 8:13)</r></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I mention this because those who believe that repentance is turning from sin often believe it is turning from sins itself that saves people from God’s wrath. Understanding that repentance is a change of mind, and that even those who are already of faith and baptized have been called to repent supports the idea that salvation isn’t dependent on works. Rather, faith in Christ as our redeemer is what saves us<r c="jn 3 16"><span class="citation" data-cites="John_3:16"><sup><a href="#ref-John_3:16" role="doc-biblioref">12</a></sup></span></r>.<a href="link saved by grace through faith article"></a></p>
<p> Where does the idea of repenting from sins, or repenting for sins in the sense of it being the action of turning from sins come from? It’s a common belief within many world religions, and is the general definition within many of their “holy texts”, since works-based salvation is also common within them. Catholicism, Mormonism, Adventism, Hinduism, Sikhism, Islam, Buddhism, Jainism, and even many Christian teachers and preachers refer to repentance as “turning from sins”<span class="citation" data-cites="no_nonsense_christianity_repent_2022"><sup><a href="#ref-no_nonsense_christianity_repent_2022" role="doc-biblioref">16</a></sup></span>. It’s clear that under worldly religions, which are under Satan’s kingdom, everyone is convinced that they can save themselves by doing good while ignoring that payment through God’s wrath is required for evil. However, when a judge judges for a crime, the verdict is either guilty or not guilty. Whether a murderer were to have given exorbitantly to charity after a murder should have no influence on a good judges ruling for the punishment in regard to the murder. In regard to sin, one can’t even give one’s entire life to save one’s own soul since all men are corrupted under their own sin, except for Jesus. Jesus however, was pure, and died in order to save all who put their faith in Him; repentance as simply “turning from sin”, when it is used to support works-based salvation, denies this gospel. It supports focusing on refraining from evil, but neglects to point to Christ’s sacrifice that was to pay for our sin debt to God (if we accept it), and fails to show that we should reflect God’s love.</p>

<p> Just as we’re to confess our sins to God, we’re also to confess our sin to those whom we have offended within the body of Christ.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p><r r="Jm 5 16">Confess your offenses to one another, and pray one for another, that you may be healed. The effective, earnest prayer of a righteous man is powerfully effective. (James 5:16)</r></p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, if we’re to confess our faults to our family in Christ, how should we do so, and how are they supposed to confess to us? You’re supposed to confess to others whenever they have a sin to hold against you.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p><r r="mt 5 23 24">“If therefore you are offering your gift at the altar, and there remember that your brother has anything against you, leave your gift there before the altar, and go your way. First be reconciled to your brother, and then come and offer your gift. (Matthew 5:23-24)</r></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This suggests that our family in Christ should do the same for us, and confess to us when we have a sin to hold against them. Not only are we to expect that others come to us in confession, but we are also to ask those who sin against us to confess to us. To those who believe that it’s offensive to ask someone else to confess a sin to you, recognize that the one asking for confession and repentance seeks restoration of the relationship. Their expression of offense should not be to bring shame to the other party; the other party will feel sufficient shame when they recognize their sin; the expression of offense should be that the offended feels genuine grief at the effect of sin on their relationship. It should also be noted that someone “taking offense” because of something you’ve done does not necessarily mean you’ve sinned against them, and sin needs to be proven through a biblical system of justice. In case you don’t agree with these ideas that you can ask others to confess to you so that you may forgive them — and that sin needs to be proven, with the presumption of innocence given — let’s examine several verses.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p><r r="Matthew 18 15 17">“If your brother sins against you, go, show him his fault between you and him alone. If he listens to you, you have gained back your brother. But if he doesn’t listen, take one or two more with you, that at the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established. If he refuses to listen to them, tell it to the assembly. If he refuses to hear the assembly also, let him be to you as a Gentile or a tax collector. (Matthew 18:15-17)</r></p>
<p><r r="lk 17 3 4">Be careful. If your brother sins against you, rebuke him. If he repents, forgive him. If he sins against you seven times in the day, and seven times returns, saying, ‘I repent,’ you shall forgive him.” (Luke 17:3-4)</r></p>
</blockquote>
<p> These verses say regaining your brother who has trespassed (sinned) against you is conditional on him listening to your grievance, with the implication that listening results in a confession. The verses give us the proper process to follow when a sibling in Christ has sinned against us. You’re to confront them about the sin between them and yourself, provided that you’re certain it’s sin; if they don’t confess and repent, you’re to first make witnesses when you confront them a second time, and then tell the congregation as the third confrontation if they still fail to confess and repent. If they aren’t willing to confess to you for what is certainly sin when the entire assembly is made witness to the issue, it suggests that something is very wrong in their spirit because of their callousness toward their own sin. You are to treat such people, who claim to be believers yet sin against you and openly refuse to biblically confess, as gentiles and tax collectors — which is to say you shouldn’t associate with them, and this was expressed in the bible in the expression of not eating with them.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p><r r="1 co 5 11">But as it is, I wrote to you not to associate with anyone who is called a brother who is a sexual sinner, or covetous, or an idolater, or a slanderer, or a drunkard, or an extortioner. Don’t even eat with such a person. (1 Corinthians 5:11)</r></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Because tax collectors aren’t visiting to be in Christian fellowship, but only to demand money from you under legal threat, you don’t bother acting as if they’re family to you as you would with a sibling in Christ.</p>
<hr>
<p> As an aside on 1 Corinthians 5:11, it should be noted that this was a command given about those who are sinners who also claim to be a part of the family of Christ. Gentiles are also not associated with in a familial fashion by the body of Christ, because they are not a part of the body. However, we’re not necessarily supposed to disassociate with everyone who is not part of the body, because then we would need to leave the world, as the context around the verse above reveals, shown here:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p><r r="1 co 5 9 13">I wrote to you in my letter to have no company with sexual sinners; yet not at all meaning with the sexual sinners of this world, or with the covetous and extortioners, or with idolaters; for then you would have to leave the world. But as it is, I wrote to you not to associate with anyone who is called a brother who is a sexual sinner, or covetous, or an idolater, or a slanderer, or a drunkard, or an extortioner. Don’t even eat with such a person. For what have I to do with also judging those who are outside? Don’t you judge those who are within? But those who are outside, God judges. “Put away the wicked man from among yourselves.” (1 Corinthians 5:9-13)</r></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some would wish to limit this lack of relationship to being between those involved in a conflict, and deny the consequence that sinners be removed from the church. However, sin in this context is a conflict within the body, and that which is not of the body cannot remain in the body. I believe this sentiment of separating sinners from the body, and not just from the individuals who are in conflict, can be observed when Paul declares that a sinner whom he has been made aware of should be removed from the congregation.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p><r r="1 co 5 1 5">It is actually reported that there is sexual immorality among you, and such sexual immorality as is not even named among the Gentiles, that one has his father’s wife. You are puffed up, and didn’t rather mourn, that he who had done this deed might be removed from among you. For I most assuredly, as being absent in body but present in spirit, have already, as though I were present, judged him who has done this thing. In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, you being gathered together, and my spirit, with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ, are to deliver such a one to Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus. (1 Corinthians 5:1-5)</r></p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p> Now, the biblical standard that sin must be proven before judgment is given:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p><r r="de 19 15 21">One witness shall not rise up against a man for any iniquity, or for any sin, in any sin that he sins: at the mouth of two witnesses, or at the mouth of three witnesses, shall a matter be established. If an unrighteous witness rise up against any man to testify against him of wrong-doing, then both the men, between whom the controversy is, shall stand before Yahweh, before the priests and the judges who shall be in those days; and the judges shall make diligent inquisition: and, behold, if the witness is a false witness, and has testified falsely against his brother; then shall you do to him, as he had thought to do to his brother: so shall you put away the evil from the midst of you. Those who remain shall hear, and fear, and shall henceforth commit no more any such evil in the midst of you. Your eyes shall not pity; life [shall go] for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot. (Deuteronomy 19:15-21)</r></p>
</blockquote>
<p>These verses show us that sin needs to be proven by the word of at least 2 witnesses — inclusive of the accuser per Matthew 18, above<r c="mt 18 15 17"><span class="citation" data-cites="Matthew_18:15-17"><sup><a href="#ref-Matthew_18:15-17" role="doc-biblioref">10</a></sup></span></r>, as well. It also declares that false accusers and witnesses are to be treated with the punishment that the accused would have received had they been guilty. We also see that along with the requirement of proof in these verses is the command for equal retribution for a sin or offense in the command that life shall go for life, eye for eye, etc. This was a part of the law of Moses, seemingly given to keep people from sinning against each other, although Paul does say its purpose was to make us recognize our sin<r c="ro 3 20"><span class="citation" data-cites="Romans_3:20"><sup><a href="#ref-Romans_3:20" role="doc-biblioref">17</a></sup></span></r>. It explains how we are to handle legal offenses through the government, and according to Maimonides, the Jewish doctors understood this as receiving money equal to the value for a legal offense, because if it was taken literally, one couldn’t be sure whether one would, for example, take only the eye of another in return for one’s eye and not also cause more harm<span class="citation" data-cites="gill_matthew_nodate"><sup><a href="#ref-gill_matthew_nodate" role="doc-biblioref">18</a></sup></span>.</p>
<p> Jesus seemed to address this issue himself — that people had taken this law to be literal, and believed that they could themselves, bypassing the ruling of government, take what they were owed for a legal offense:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p><r r="mt 5 38 44">“You have heard that it was said, ‘An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth.’ But I tell you, don’t resist him who is evil; but whoever strikes you on your right cheek, turn to him the other also. If anyone sues you to take away your coat, let him have your cloak also. Whoever compels you to go one mile, go with him two. Give to him who asks you, and don’t turn away him who desires to borrow from you.”You have heard that it was said, ‘You shall love your neighbor, and hate your enemy.’ But I tell you, love your enemies, bless those who curse you, do good to those who hate you, and pray for those who mistreat you and persecute you, (Matthew 5:38-44)</r></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here, rather than attempting to even the scales, so to speak, we’re encouraged to not only refuse to return evil for evil, but to show those who offend us the same grace and mercy that God has shown us. When Jesus was taken to be crucified, he explained that he had the ability to defend himself from evil:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p><r r="mt 26 51 54">Behold, one of those who were with Jesus stretched out his hand, and drew his sword, and struck the servant of the high priest, and struck off his ear. Then Jesus said to him, “Put your sword back into its place, for all those who take the sword will die by the sword. Or do you think that I couldn’t ask my Father, and he would even now send me more than twelve legions of angels? How then would the Scriptures be fulfilled that it must be so?” (Matthew 26:51-54)</r></p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, he still remained on the cross when crucified, despite being told that he should save himself<r c="lk 23 37, lk 23 39"><span class="citation" data-cites="Luke_23:37 Luke_23:39"><sup><a href="#ref-Luke_23:37" role="doc-biblioref">19</a>,<a href="#ref-Luke_23:39" role="doc-biblioref">20</a></sup></span></r>. Rather than return evil for evil, he showed the love of God by becoming the sacrifice for our sins. So, when evil is done against us, we’re to show people the same love that God has shown us by withholding wrath, and showing mercy and grace. Note that this turning of the other cheek is not encouraging pacifism. Christ went to his death because he knew it was required to save us; He told his disciples to carry swords<r c="lk 22 36 38"><span class="citation" data-cites="Luke_22:36-38"><sup><a href="#ref-Luke_22:36-38" role="doc-biblioref">21</a></sup></span></r>, yet rebuked Simon Peter for using one to keep Jesus from being captured in the garden scenario before his crucifixion, which suggests to me that this was an exception to the intention of carrying swords for self-defense<r c="jn 18 11"><span class="citation" data-cites="John_18:11"><sup><a href="#ref-John_18:11" role="doc-biblioref">22</a></sup></span></r>. The bible does suggest that self-defense and the defense of others is good<r c="ex 22 2, ps 144 1"><span class="citation" data-cites="Exodus_22:2 Psalms_144:1"><sup><a href="#ref-Exodus_22:2" role="doc-biblioref">23</a>,<a href="#ref-Psalms_144:1" role="doc-biblioref">24</a></sup></span></r>. Because of the cultural context of the time, a strike on the cheek was not an attack on someone that would require self-defense, but it was a reproach. The passage is also not encouraging us to allow theft, since it’s referring to a justified law suit in court, and the other example is referring to a loan, for which repayment is at least agreed upon (though we’re also told not to expect repayment even if it is in the terms of agreement<r c="lk 6 33 35"><span class="citation" data-cites="Luke_6:33-35"><sup><a href="#ref-Luke_6:33-35" role="doc-biblioref">25</a></sup></span></r>). The point of not resisting an evil person seems to be to reflect God’s refusal to demand immediate repayment for our sins, which we couldn’t repay anyway; he instead offers to restore our relationship with him by offering to pay this debt for us through his gift of Christ’s sacrifice if we confess and repent. After we receive this gift, he expects us to show the same love to others whenever possible, just as we do (when we forgive those who confess that they have sinned against us) because we’ve been forgiven by God. However, one can’t show that love by failing to attempt to defend oneself from mortal threats; this would be a failure to honor God’s temple (a believer’s body) which we should be willing to defend, and how can anyone defend the allowing of murder, whether it’s oneself or another.</p>
<section id="justice_self-service">
<p> To clarify, we must understand that the Matthew 5:38 passage is not removing the need for payment due to sins — because God will not universally forgive all sins — nor is it removing the role of government in a court system, which is ordained by God; it is saying that in our personal lives we should not pursue retribution through our own power. It’s not saying that government shouldn’t do its job in accordance with the Old Testament, or that people shouldn’t be able to use the courts (though the body of Christ is told to handle offenses within itself<r c="1 co 6 1 8"><span class="citation" data-cites="1_Corinthians_6:1-8"><sup><a href="#ref-1_Corinthians_6:1-8" role="doc-biblioref">26</a></sup></span></r>); it’s a message that we should not misinterpret what the Word says about government and believe that we can take justice into our own hands.</p>
<p> There’s also the question of whether believers need to confess their sins to unbelievers, since believers aren’t generally to associate with unbelievers <r c="1 co 5 9 11"><span class="citation" data-cites="1_Corinthians_5:9-11"><sup><a href="#ref-1_Corinthians_5:9-11" role="doc-biblioref">27</a></sup></span></r>. I haven’t seen much in the Word to apply to this, but I have some thoughts. Confession to an unbeliever will probably result in one of the usual improper reactions — either discounting the sin, or attempting to convict you with your confession. The conviction could perhaps be legally, so if you’ll be punished for something that’s not a sin by confessing a sin to an unbeliever, then perhaps it’s not worth it since you’re not required to associate with them anyway. Perhaps the confession could be left between yourself and God. However, honest confession is not often seen by the world. Perhaps by confessing to them — and pointing to Jesus’s sacrifice for our sin, and God’s forgiveness — we can lead them to Christ.</p>

<p> If we’re to forgive as we were forgiven,</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p><r r="co 3 13">bearing with one another, and forgiving each other, if any man has a complaint against any; even as Christ forgave you, so you also do. (Colossians 3:13)</r></p>
</blockquote>
<p>then how were we forgiven?</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p><r r="1 jn 1 9">If we confess our sins, he is faithful and righteous to forgive us the sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness. (1 John 1:9)</r></p>
</blockquote>
<p>“If we confess our sins”, then we’re forgiven. This shows that forgiveness is subsequent to confession — because of the word “if”, which makes forgiveness conditional. Another verse that supports confession being required for forgiveness is,</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p><r r="lk 17 3 4">Be careful. If your brother sins against you, rebuke him. If he repents, forgive him. If he sins against you seven times in the day, and seven times returns, saying, ‘I repent,’ you shall forgive him.” (Luke 17:3-4)</r></p>
</blockquote>
<p>While this says “repent”, and not “confess”, the statement of repentance is itself a confession.</p>
<p> I’ve also noticed that, because there are some verses that don’t mention confession when speaking on forgiveness, some believe one must forgive even when not confessed to. We must take the message of the Bible as a whole, or we will misunderstand it and act inappropriately. I think I’ve already shown that confession must precede forgiveness<r c="1 jn 1 9, lk 17 3 4, mt 18 15 17"><span class="citation" data-cites="1_John_1:9 Luke_17:3-4 Matthew_18:15-17"><sup><a href="#ref-1_John_1:9" role="doc-biblioref">1</a>,<a href="#ref-Matthew_18:15-17" role="doc-biblioref">10</a>,<a href="#ref-Luke_17:3-4" role="doc-biblioref">11</a></sup></span></r>, and this should show that when the Bible mentions forgiveness in isolation then the prerequisite confession is implied. This implicitly required confession of sin (perhaps through confession of faith in Christ) would be implicit in verses such as,</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p><r r="ep 4 32">And be kind to one another, tenderhearted, forgiving each other, just as God also in Christ forgave you. (Ephesians 4:32)</r></p>
<p><r r="lk 11 4">Forgive us our sins, For we ourselves also forgive everyone who is indebted to us. Bring us not into temptation, But deliver us from the evil one.’” (Luke 11:4)</r></p>
<p><r r="mt 6 14">“For if you forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you. (Matthew 6:14)</r></p>
<p><r r="mt 18 32 35">Then his lord called him in, and said to him, ‘You wicked servant! I forgave you all that debt, because you begged me. Shouldn’t you also have had mercy on your fellow servant, even as I had mercy on you?’ His lord was angry, and delivered him to the tormentors, until he should pay all that was due to him. So my heavenly Father will also do to you, if you don’t each forgive your brother from your hearts for his misdeeds.” (Matthew 18:32-35)</r></p>
<p><r r="lk 6 37">Don’t judge, And you won’t be judged. Don’t condemn, And you won’t be condemned. Set free, And you will be set free. (Luke 6:37)</r></p>
<p><r r="co 3 13">bearing with one another, and forgiving each other, if any man has a complaint against any; even as Christ forgave you, so you also do. (Colossians 3:13)</r></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In a scenario where someone is indebted to you, cannot pay, and denies that they ever owed you in the first place, why would you forgive them of this debt when they’ve refused to recognize that it even exists? If the debtor refuses to admit they owe you, then they claim you have nothing to forgive them for, and therefore deny your potential forgiveness. If you were to forgive them, their denial of debt is a claim that your payment of their debt (by accepting the loss) is worthless. This is why God requires confession, a recognition of debt, before forgiveness.</p>
<p> I’ve heard it suggested, because of the belief that forgiveness is universally required, that withholding forgiveness due to a lack of confession will lead one to harbor bitterness in their heart. This suggestion seems correct to many because many people do remain bitter in unforgiveness. The reason this bitterness is a problem is that the Bible tells us not to be bitter:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p><r r="ep 4 31 32">Let all bitterness, wrath, anger, outcry, and slander, be put away from you, with all malice. And be kind to one another, tenderhearted, forgiving each other, just as God also in Christ forgave you. (Ephesians 4:31-32)</r></p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, there’s nothing about withholding forgiveness that must necessarily make one bitter. How do I know this? Since I’ve explained that the Word speaks of sin using financial analogies, I also say there’s nothing about requiring payment for a debt (sin) that requires bitterness. I do believe this perception about bitterness in unforgiveness comes from our culture’s misunderstanding of offense, which is that it’s anything that upsets one emotionally; as such, bitterness seems to our culture to be a required emotional response to an “offense”. God Himself is not required to be bitter about sin that remains unforgiven, so we can’t — being made in His image — assert that every person must be bitter about sin that’s unforgiven. Those who say you’ll be bitter if you don’t universally forgive fail to recognize that God does not forgive unrepentant sinners, and yet He is not bitter and still expresses His love for us by offering Christ’s sacrifice to us. The only payment for sin is God’s wrath. The debt against us and against God either will be paid by wrath against the sinner, or has been paid by the cup of wrath that was poured out against Christ on the cross. Christ is the reason Christians must forgive their siblings in Christ when confessed to by them<r c="mt 18 32 35"><span class="citation" data-cites="Matthew_18:32-35"><sup><a href="#ref-Matthew_18:32-35" role="doc-biblioref">13</a></sup></span></r> — because Christians owed God for their sin and could not pay<r c="ro 5 8"><span class="citation" data-cites="Romans_5:8"><sup><a href="#ref-Romans_5:8" role="doc-biblioref">28</a></sup></span></r>, yet were still forgiven when they confessed to Him<r c="1 John 1 9"><span class="citation" data-cites="1_John_1:9"><sup><a href="#ref-1_John_1:9" role="doc-biblioref">1</a></sup></span></r>.</p>
<p> One more challenging verse to explain that seems, upon initial reading, to support universal forgiveness is,</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p><r r="mk 11 25">Whenever you stand praying, forgive, if you have anything against anyone; so that your Father, who is in heaven, may also forgive you your transgressions. (Mark 11:25)</r></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This seems challenging because similar to Matthew 18’s parable of the unforgiving servant, it makes forgiveness seem to be entirely dependent on our own forgiveness of others, while seemingly indicating no conditions to our forgiveness or whom we’re to forgive. This seeming contradiction is similar to</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p><r r="mt 7 1">“Don’t judge, so that you won’t be judged. (Matthew 7:1)</r></p>
</blockquote>
<p>when compared with</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p><r r="jn 7 24">Don’t judge according to appearance, but judge righteous judgment.” (John 7:24)</r></p>
</blockquote>
<p>When Matthew 7 says that we’re not to judge, it’s not meant in a way that would contradict that we’re required to judge in order to rebuke sin within the body<r c="lk 17 3"><span class="citation" data-cites="Luke_17:3"><sup><a href="#ref-Luke_17:3" role="doc-biblioref">29</a></sup></span></r>. It’s telling us — in context — to judge righteously — in a way that won’t cause judgment against ourselves:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p><r r="mt 7 2 5">For with whatever judgment you judge, you will be judged; and with whatever measure you measure, it will be measured to you. Why do you see the speck that is in your brother’s eye, but don’t consider the beam that is in your own eye? Or how will you tell your brother, ‘Let me remove the speck from your eye;’ and behold, the beam is in your own eye? You hypocrite!

<p> There’s the perception in some Christian spheres that once we receive forgiveness for sin through our faith in Christ, we no longer need to confess our sins to God or to one another; we can know this is false because the Bible tells us to confront one another about sin<r c="mt 18 15 17, lk 17 3 4"><span class="citation" data-cites="Matthew_18:15-17 Luke_17:3-4"><sup><a href="#ref-Matthew_18:15-17" role="doc-biblioref">10</a>,<a href="#ref-Luke_17:3-4" role="doc-biblioref">11</a></sup></span></r>, and to confess to God<r c="Matthew 6 12"><span class="citation" data-cites="Matthew_6:12"><sup><a href="#ref-Matthew_6:12" role="doc-biblioref">8</a></sup></span></r>.

<section id="admission-vs-confession" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="admission-vs-confession">Admission vs confession</h4>
<p> Lest anyone should confess with the wrong heart, I’ll say that confession means more than simply acknowledging one has done something that offends someone; it also means admitting that the action referred to was sin (supposing that it was), which is deserving of God’s wrath, and that sinning damages our relationship with the God who created us. I say this because some can admit to having committed a sin and not have remorse over it; this may be because they don’t realize that it’s sinful, or because they are hard-hearted and don’t care that it was a sin. This kind of simple admission would not lead to the change in heart that God seeks, which would recognize the destruction their sin causes and turns away from it.</p>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="false-confession">False confession</h4>
<p> It should be clear from the concept that sin must be proven that you should not confess to a sin you didn’t commit. However, doing so is often considered good in some Christian cultures. Some misconstrue resolution and closure as universally positive. In this case, they seek to bypass the process of restoring relationships in the pursuit of an immediate resolution and preemptive closure. It should go without saying that confessing to an uncommitted sin is lying and as such counts as sin; however, when feelings are hurt, some would rather seek resolution at the cost of truth and their own integrity, and even call doing so virtuous. As another consequence of confessing to uncommitted sin, if the person you confess to does not have forgiveness in their heart, you’ve set yourself up for what will seem to them to be a justified punishment, and you yourself said you deserve it. Ask yourself whether your church family’s culture favors forgiveness over confession, or vice versa. Most seem to err of the side of forgiveness without confession, using verses out of context that speak about forgiveness without mentioning the implicit and prerequisite confession. Why is this so? Perhaps because it’s difficult to confront people about their sin, and easy to tell people to forgive so the issue doesn’t have to be dealt with publicly as a community; with God, it is not so.</p>

<p> Confession for the purpose of hurting someone emotionally is also not biblical confession; this kind of “confession” would really be an admission without guilt, acknowledging the evil and even reveling in the pain and relational division that it causes. An example could be a spouse who’s not scared of divorce admitting, for the sake of causing emotional turmoil in their spouse, to having committed adultery. Another could be a supposed believer admitting, for the sake of hurting another, that they never truly cared about their supposed sibling in Christ, and that they deceitfully used the other person for some benefit. Any confession that is a lie for the sake of emotionally hurting someone is also wrong.</p>

<section id="condemned-by-association" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="condemned-by-association">Condemned by association</h4>
<p> A similar result comes from another misunderstanding of confession that I’ve encountered, which is that we may be responsible for the sins of others. This idea has perhaps been popularized by intersectional politics. In contexts of religion, it asserts that you are guilty of sin, by association, for the past sins of the groups you associate with, or that you belong to genetically or ideologically. This idea often plays out as an accusation that you’re responsible for the past sins, which you didn’t commit yourself, of your ancestors. Within a Christian setting, it also asserts that you’re responsible for the sins belonging to the church throughout history; the sins of the church are often claimed to be the crusades, and cooperating with segregation and encouraging slaves to submit to their masters. Culturally, it criticizes the founding fathers of the united states of America for the treatment of the native Americans, or it may associate men with the “sins against Feminism” which oppressed women throughout history. Whether those events happened as they’re often described in those categories or not, and whether they’re sin or not, this idea that you may be responsible for the sins of others is antithetical to biblical justice. It should go without saying that one is not responsible for a sin they don’t commit, because if one was then all would be guilty by association. If all were guilty by association, then Jesus would be guilty also — and there is no hope for you if you aren’t redeemed by the sinless Christ, because all men aside from Him have sinned<r c="ro 3 23"><span class="citation" data-cites="Romans_3:23"><sup><a href="#ref-Romans_3:23" role="doc-biblioref">31</a></sup></span></r>. Within the kingdom, because of Jesus’s sacrifice, there is hope through forgiveness when you confess your sins. Ultimately, the intersectional guilt ideology does not seek this forgiveness, though God does; the end goal is to consider someone guilty for the sins of another so that they may be condemned, judged by the world, and punished as the world sees fit. What is even more stunning in light of our understanding of biblical forgiveness, is that church leaders who are pursuing unity concede to this ideology to try to reach more people. They don’t realize that by agreeing with this ideology, they’ve been ensnared by the actual purpose of it, which is to permit others to judge and condemn them so that the structures of God can be subverted, taken over, and made to serve the evil one. The results of this in the future may be seen to be physical death at the hands of a self-righteous group that denies the Word of God and seeks to condemn those belonging to the world’s hegemony<span class="citation" data-cites="friendship_baptist_church_of_girard_ohio_biblical_2021"><sup><a href="#ref-friendship_baptist_church_of_girard_ohio_biblical_2021" role="doc-biblioref">32</a></sup></span>.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-alternative-to-confession-is-judgment">The alternative to confession is judgment</h3>
<p> Since God’s forgiveness depends on our confession of sin, God’s wrath is required to be fulfilled against us if we refuse to put our faith in the redemptive power of Jesus’s sacrifice on the cross, which was a remittal of payment for our sin. Without Jesus’s payment for our sins, our confession of sin would have no power, since we would still be condemned under the sin. However, His work, and our faith in its power, allow us to be justified because it paid the debt that we owed.</p>
<p> There’s a connotation for judgment, that it is associated with someone’s feelings toward you. Judgment may also refer to someone’s discernment about a situation. When we discuss biblical judgment for sin, its meaning is more like a judgment made within a court. The understanding that sin is based on feelings also causes the suggestion that those who are willing to confront sin are judgmental. Imagine that someone has sinned against you, and you want to confront them so that they can confess, with the intended result being their forgiveness so that the relationship can continue. Some would say that this will to seek confession is judgmental, and that it’s a negative thing. It is not a sin in itself to hold someone accountable for what is known to be sin; those who attempt to do so within the body because it’s required<r c="mt 18 15 17"><span class="citation" data-cites="Matthew_18:15-17"><sup><a href="#ref-Matthew_18:15-17" role="doc-biblioref">10</a></sup></span></r> are often called judgmental, with the connotation being negative, as if they shouldn’t hold an offender accountable. This definition of judgment is unbiblical, and supports universal forgiveness because it suggests that requiring confession is sinful in itself. It’s often argued by those who would rather have no one be judged, because confrontation leading to condemnation is uncomfortable. This wrong definition of judgment, when applied, is also often used within the body to allow sin for people who are well-liked and whom people would not like to confront or condemn. This tells the sinner that they can sin without consequence, or “within reason”, as long as the church can tolerate it, and indirectly tells the offended party that they must suffer the sins of others with no repayment, and that sins against them won’t be recognized — which is to say they’re not worth defending against sin. While allowing sin is wrong, this scenario also goes against the lack of favoritism that’s required within the body of Christ:</p>

<p> It is necessary to forgive when confessed to by a sibling in Christ; this is a fundamental representation of the love Christ has shown us. To truly grasp how wonderful forgiveness is, and how serious the topic of sin is, consider that our court systems are inspired by biblical accounts. The difference between court and our relationships in the kingdom is that in court there is no forgiveness, and punishment for the guilty is ideally certain. We are guilty for our sin; the wrath of God toward this sin is certain. However, those of faith have been shown great mercy by the Father; we’ve been given the unique opportunity to accept Jesus’s punishment as a substitute for ours. The very God we’ve trespassed against has offered his own life through Jesus to redeem us to show us his love. This is the greatest gift that could be given, and it brings glory to God. We should seek to understand exactly what this means according to the Word so that we can learn to forgive as the Father has, and reflect the love he has shown us.</p>
<section id="positional-forgiveness" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="positional-forgiveness">Positional forgiveness</h4>
<section id="positional-forgiveness">
<p> There’s an important question to consider that comes from two Christian concepts — that we’re forgiven of sins through faith in Christ<r c="jn 3 16"><span class="citation" data-cites="John_3:16"><sup><a href="#ref-John_3:16" role="doc-biblioref">12</a></sup></span></r>, and that we’re told to confess our sins<r c="lk 17 3 4, mt 18 15 17, jm 5 16"><span class="citation" data-cites="Luke_17:3-4 Matthew_18:15-17 James_5:16"><sup><a href="#ref-Matthew_18:15-17" role="doc-biblioref">10</a>,<a href="#ref-Luke_17:3-4" role="doc-biblioref">11</a>,<a href="#ref-James_5:16" role="doc-biblioref">33</a></sup></span></r>. If our sins are forgiven through faith in Christ, why are we also told to confess our sins? The answer I’ve seen given for this is called “positional forgiveness”. Positional forgiveness refers to the fact that one’s faith in Christ justifies oneself with God judicially. This is coupled with a concept called “fellowship forgiveness”, which refers to the fact that sins must be confessed upon realization or confrontation in order for the offender to remain in familial fellowship with the body of Christ and God Himself. Some are resistant to the concept because it teaches that there are two types of forgiveness. I’d says, though, that they’re related under one concept, and I think viewing them separately fails to see the point of forgiveness. Christ died for our sins so that when we put our faith in Him, we are justified<r c="jn 3 16"><span class="citation" data-cites="John_3:16"><sup><a href="#ref-John_3:16" role="doc-biblioref">12</a></sup></span></r>. He paid for our sins, which restores our ability to be one with Christ as a body; Christ is our head<r c="ep 5 23"><span class="citation" data-cites="Ephesians_5:23"><sup><a href="#ref-Ephesians_5:23" role="doc-biblioref">4</a></sup></span></r>. However, we can’t continue to live in sin after our justification<r c="ro 6 1 2"><span class="citation" data-cites="Romans_6:1-2"><sup><a href="#ref-Romans_6:1-2" role="doc-biblioref">14</a></sup></span></r>. The body, being under Christ (Christ is the head of the body), can’t live in sin and be one with the one who is sinless. Though our sins are forgiven, we must come into agreement with Christ in acknowledgement of our sins continually, in order that they’re addressed, so that it’s clear they aren’t allowed to continue and that we don’t wish to continue in them. This concept of dissociation is explained within the body in:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p><r r="mt 18 15 17">“If your brother sins against you, go, show him his fault between you and him alone. If he listens to you, you have gained back your brother. But if he doesn’t listen, take one or two more with you, that at the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established. If he refuses to listen to them, tell it to the assembly. If he refuses to hear the assembly also, let him be to you as a Gentile or a tax collector. (Matthew 18:15-17)</r></p>
<p><r r="lk 17 3 4">Be careful. If your brother sins against you, rebuke him. If he repents, forgive him. If he sins against you seven times in the day, and seven times returns, saying, ‘I repent,’ you shall forgive him.” (Luke 17:3-4)</r></p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, if one within the body refuses to acknowledge sin once confronted, and come into agreement that it is sin, that it can’t be tolerated, and that your intent is to refrain from continuing in this sin, then one must be dissociated with by the body of Christ which is, through this action, operating under the command of His headship. While we’re forgiven upon our placement of faith in Christ, to continue in unconfessed sin would deny the proper response to this grace which was shown to us. To continue with no remorse in the very thing that separated us from God shows that one doesn’t wish to have fellowship with God.</p>
<p> If one suggests that we are to forgive without confession, then one contradicts these verses about confession. However, another possible alternative to positional forgiveness is that you forfeit justification with God until you confess your sin, including for each new sin. If we realize that believers are required to confess sin continually<r c="mt 6 12, mt 18 15 17, lk 17 3 4, jm 5 16"><span class="citation" data-cites="Matthew_6:12 Matthew_18:15-17 Luke_17:3-4 James_5:16"><sup><a href="#ref-Matthew_6:12" role="doc-biblioref">8</a>,<a href="#ref-Matthew_18:15-17" role="doc-biblioref">10</a>,<a href="#ref-Luke_17:3-4" role="doc-biblioref">11</a>,<a href="#ref-James_5:16" role="doc-biblioref">33</a></sup></span></r>, then the dilemma Christians face under this belief (that forgiveness affects justification) is that they lose their salvation if they fail to recognize some given sin and confess it, or if they happen to die before confessing a sin. However, if justification through faith in Christ is separate from forgiveness (per positional forgiveness), then confession may still be required for forgiveness without threatening justification, and one may still be justified through faith in Christ without having confessed to every sin and without having been forgiven for every sin. As far as I can tell from biblical passages, sin must be recognized through confession before one can properly be forgiven by the affected parties; I would suppose this means unconfessed sin is able to be confessed to and forgiven of the justified believer on judgment day.</p>

<section id="is-universal-forgiveness-biblical" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="is-universal-forgiveness-biblical">Is universal forgiveness biblical?</h4>
<p> The first misunderstanding I’d like to address regarding forgiveness is a common belief that results in the (perhaps unintentional) endorsement of universal forgiveness. Some would say we must forgive because we’re forgiven, and that this forgiveness is to be extended to all people no matter what. Others would restrict this forgiveness to apply within the body of Christ. I think the word is clear, however, that we’re to extend forgiveness to those who call themselves our family in Christ, and only when they also confess their sin to us. However, first let’s examine the arguments that result in the support of universal forgiveness.</p>
<p> Some also consider Christ’s words on the cross,</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p><r r="lk 23 34">Jesus said, “Father, forgive them, for they don’t know what they are doing.” Dividing his garments among them, they cast lots. (Luke 23:34)</r></p>
</blockquote>
<p>to support forgiveness without confession. I would argue that this comment was Jesus’s display of his willingness to forgive them. Keeping mind that forgiveness is mentioned without confession, even when confession is required for forgiveness, it seems to me that He’s showing His grace in an expression which would mean, “When they realize what they’ve done, they confess it, and they repent, don’t withhold their forgiveness from them, even when their hateful actions ultimately resulted in me being condemned and murdered at their hands as if it were justified, although I am faultless.” This understanding seems to be echoed in Acts, where it’s shown that those who crucified him were ignorant of what they were doing, and also that they were being called to repentance. “The multitude” of Jews in Acts 2<r c="ac 2 5 6"><span class="citation" data-cites="Acts_2:5-6"><sup><a href="#ref-Acts_2:5-6" role="doc-biblioref">34</a></sup></span></r> are also seen responding to this message:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p><r r="ac 3 17 19">“Now, brothers{The word for”brothers” here may be also correctly translated “brothers and sisters” or “siblings.”}, I know that you did this in ignorance, as did also your rulers. But the things which God announced by the mouth of all his prophets, that Christ should suffer, he thus fulfilled. “Repent therefore, and turn again, that your sins may be blotted out, so that there may come times of refreshing from the presence of the Lord, (Acts 3:17-19)</r></p>
<p><r r="ac 2 36 39">“Let all the house of Israel therefore know assuredly that God has made him both Lord and Christ, this Jesus whom you crucified.” Now when they heard this, they were cut to the heart, and said to Peter and the rest of the apostles, “Brothers, what shall we do?” Peter said to them, “Repent, and be baptized, everyone of you, in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of sins, and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. For to you is the promise, and to your children, and to all who are far off, even as many as the Lord our God will call to himself.” (Acts 2:36-39)</r></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s also significant that his prayer that they would be forgiven fulfills prophecy from Isaiah, that Jesus would intercede for sinners:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p><r r="is 53 12">Therefore will I divide him a portion with the great, and he shall divide the spoil with the strong; because he poured out his soul to death, and was numbered with the transgressors: yet he bore the sin of many, and made intercession for the transgressors. (Isaiah 53:12)</r></p>
</blockquote>
<p> Another reason to believe this wasn’t Christ simply pardoning sin is because there are examples where Christ does forgive sin by saying, “Your sins are forgiven.”, and there’s no reason he couldn’t use the same phrasing here. These examples are also spoken in response to faith in Him which is noted in each instance, so the precedent of faith in Christ resulting in forgiveness of sins is still upheld here, and I’ll restate here that faith in Christ’s work is implicitly confession of sin, and the acknowledgement of his redemptive power. Let’s examine these verses.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p><r r="lk 5 18 20">Behold, men brought a paralyzed man on a cot, and they sought to bring him in to lay before Jesus. Not finding a way to bring him in because of the multitude, they went up to the housetop, and let him down through the tiles with his cot into the midst before Jesus. Seeing their faith, he said to him, “Man, your sins are forgiven you.” (Luke 5:18-20)</r></p>
<p><r r="lk 23 41 43">And we indeed justly, for we receive the due reward for our deeds, but this man has done nothing wrong.” He said to Jesus, “Lord, remember me when you come into your Kingdom.” Jesus said to him, “Assuredly I tell you, today you will be with me in Paradise.” (Luke 23:41-43)</r></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The first example explicitly says faith was seen before forgiveness. In the second example, the convict explicitly confesses his sin by acknowledging his just punishment before asking Jesus to remember him in His kingdom, showing his faith in Christ’s redemptive power. He’s then told he will be with Jesus in paradise (supposedly meaning he’d be in Abraham’s Bosom), which means he must have been forgiven, and this was due to his faith.</p>
<p>  Another passage that’s used to support universal forgiveness is the end of Matthew 18:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p><r r="mt 18 32 35">Then his lord called him in, and said to him, ‘You wicked servant! I forgave you all that debt, because you begged me. Shouldn’t you also have had mercy on your fellow servant, even as I had mercy on you?’ His lord was angry, and delivered him to the tormentors, until he should pay all that was due to him. So my heavenly Father will also do to you, if you don’t each forgive your brother from your hearts for his misdeeds.” (Matthew 18:32-35)</r></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s usually used in conjunction with the verse about Jesus’s words on the cross that requested the forgiveness of his murderers (with it being interpreted as meaning that everyone was forgiven)<r c="lk 23 34"><span class="citation" data-cites="Luke_23:34"><sup><a href="#ref-Luke_23:34" role="doc-biblioref">35</a></sup></span></r>. These 2 passages are together often misconstrued as meaning, “If you don’t forgive universally as Jesus did on the cross, even while he was being tortured to death, mind you, you too will be tormented for eternity.”. They may also argue that all sin within the body of Christ should be forgiven since we’ve confessed our sins to God by putting our faith in him as our redeemer. However, when God Himself gives us instructions to confront sin within the body, with dissociation being the consequence for not confessing<r c="mt 18 15 17"><span class="citation" data-cites="Matthew_18:15-17"><sup><a href="#ref-Matthew_18:15-17" role="doc-biblioref">10</a></sup></span></r>, then we know that blanket forgiveness within the church, without confession, is not His will. The point is that those who are truly in the body of Christ will confess their sins to one another<r c="jm 5 16"><span class="citation" data-cites="James_5:16"><sup><a href="#ref-James_5:16" role="doc-biblioref">33</a></sup></span></r>, just as they confess their sins to God (as stated in the Lord’s prayer<r c="mt 6 12"><span class="citation" data-cites="Matthew_6:12"><sup><a href="#ref-Matthew_6:12" role="doc-biblioref">8</a></sup></span></r>). And those who don’t put their faith in Christ won’t be forgiven.</p>
<p>  Is there then any way to receive forgiveness without confession or repentance? No, only forbearance, a temporary overlooking of the sin in a display of God’s mercy, can be received in this case. This is an important passage that explains the forbearance of God. It explains that Jesus paid for past sins that had been forborne by God:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p><r r="ro 3 24 26">being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus; whom God set forth to be an atoning sacrifice{or, a propitiation}, through faith in his blood, for a demonstration of his righteousness through the passing over of prior sins, in God’s forbearance; to demonstrate his righteousness at this present time; that he might himself be just, and the justifier of him who has faith in Jesus. (Romans 3:24-26)</r></p>
</blockquote>

<section id="is-forgiveness-before-confession-required" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="is-forgiveness-before-confession-required">Is forgiveness before confession required?</h4>
<p> Similar to how some suggest that we should confess to uncommitted sin for the sake of closure, some also suggest forgiveness should come before confession because the immediate closure for the offended appears to be a positive thing. However, without biblical confession, the offended can’t be sure the offender doesn’t intend to sin against them in the future. Unconfessed sin must be counted against the perpetrator until they confess, unless it’s something the offended wishes to overlook with forbearance. This idea of forgiving as soon as possible has also been turned into a self-serving solution to make people feel better about being able to “move on” from a situation, though they haven’t received justice (in the case that a sin actually was committed). Forgiveness for a grievous sin before it’s even acknowledged, or while confession to the sin is actively being denied, subverts justice for the offender. For the sake of the offender, they’re given the presumption of innocence; there is no consideration of forgiveness until a sin is proven because someone who is innocent requires no forgiveness, and to declare someone to be forgiven is an assertion that they’ve sinned; in this example, if they haven’t sinned then they’ve been falsely convicted and then forgiven, often for the sake of closure again, or so that someone can feel virtuous about having “oh so mercifully” forgiven another. Forgiving someone without proving they’ve sinned is not merciful; it’s denying them the right to the presumption of innocence, which is declaring them guilty until proven innocent, and then believing that oneself is virtuous for having forgiven an unproven and potentially nonexistent sin. In this example, the one that was presumed to be offended has become the offender. To clarify what “proof” means in this context, it is similar to proof in a court of law. Ideally, the offender would confess to a sin they committed so the relationship can be restored through forgiveness. However, if the offender can bring forth proof of sin, and the offender still does not confess, then they should not be associated with as family within the body of Christ, in accordance with the process in Matthew 18<r c="mt 18 15 17"><span class="citation" data-cites="Matthew_18:15-17"><sup><a href="#ref-Matthew_18:15-17" role="doc-biblioref">10</a></sup></span></r>. In a case where proof cannot be found, it’s necessary to give the defendant the benefit of the doubt due to the presumption of innocence. Unless the offender is known to the victim to be withholding confession (for something that is proven to be sin, but hasn’t been proven to have been committed by the defendant), then the victim should be willing to continue in relationship if proof cannot be found. If a person knows that they’ve been sinned against, in that the action taken is known to be sin, and there is simply insufficient proof to expel the offender from the body of Christ, I’d say the offended individual ought not feel guilt for ceasing to fellowship with the offender.</p>
<p> What does the body do in a situation wherein one person within the body makes a claim against another in the body without being able to present proof, and the other denies the claim, since we can’t convict without proof due to the concern of false conviction? If we leave the supposed offender in the body, would the accuser deny association with them? If so, how could we know that they weren’t making a false claim that this was simply an expression of hatred to have them removed from the body without cause, so that they would have to suffer not only the false claim, but false conviction by their own family. I suppose in this situation, the only thing to do is examine the future actions of each party. If we know believers by their fruit, then eventually, probably soon, the one who is truly outside of the body will refuse to confess something that there is proof for. It is, after all, the struggle of good to suffer evil for the sake of true perfect justice at the hand of God.</p>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="false-confessions">False confessions</h4>
<p> Another way I think confession and forgiveness are abused is by parties who wish to use them to remove accountability for their actions. In a scenario where someone hasn’t confessed a grievous sin which threatens a relationship, and it is found out by the offended, any remorse shown by the offender may be an attempt to remove consequences for their actions while they actually have no regret for their actions; in this case, they’re only afraid of the consequences of their actions. It’s often expressed as, “They’re not sorry for their sin, they’re sorry that they were caught in sin.”. In this example, the offender is only regretful that their sin was brought to light, and that they will lose something because of it. In this kind of scenario, it’s possible that the offender is not seeking forgiveness, because if they were then they would have confessed their sin to the offended party beforehand, unless this confrontation were so soon afterward that they didn’t have a chance to confess, or they simply didn’t understand that what they were doing was sinful. In the situation where sin was actively hidden, the offender was seeking removal of wrath, judgment, and consequences that are justified against the sin they aren’t sorry for. Now, not only does a sin need to be forgiven, but also that it was intentionally withheld deceitfully. If this situation is encountered, it’s impossible to know whether someone is truly remorseful<r c="1 ki 8 39"><span class="citation" data-cites="1_Kings_8:39"><sup><a href="#ref-1_Kings_8:39" role="doc-biblioref">36</a></sup></span></r>, so it seems forgiveness is still required while understanding that this doesn’t require immediately attempting to restore the relationship to it’s former state; one can only move forward since sin cannot be undone, and since it was not confessed, but hidden, it may take time to build trust again even when the person is considered to be part of the body. The offended party may wish to confirm that there’s a repentant heart and that they’re not simply being pushed or manipulated into relationship with someone who doesn’t truly love them (this isn’t referring to marital relationships, but to relationships at the level of the body of Christ). Because this misunderstanding of confession and forgiveness is common within the world that doesn’t know God, our familial relationships are in the body of Christ, seeking to together understand these fundamental concepts that are within His Word. The body helps maintain itself, and helps to keep out foreign bodies, just as our own bodies do. This supports the true redemption of relationships through Christ’s work.</p>
<p> Consider a scenario I’ve heard in which it may be difficult to determine the heart of a person asking for forgiveness: A spouse divorces or leaves their partner simply because they’re emotionally dissatisfied, and marries another who satisfies them (this would constitute adultery<r c="mt 19 9"><span class="citation" data-cites="Matthew_19:9"><sup><a href="#ref-Matthew_19:9" role="doc-biblioref">37</a></sup></span></r>, and so would be considered sinful). Suppose also that the church dissociates from them because of a lack of confession. This person later asks their former spouse for “forgiveness as a blessing in their current relationship”. Some would say that if they ask for forgiveness, you simply must comply, since asking for forgiveness implies confession. However, before forgiving them, I would suggest asking whether they truly regret having made their original decision. If it’s not the case that they do regret it, are apologizing, and are repentant, with a heart to not do the same to their current spouse — but it is that they’re simply looking for removal of debt so that they don’t have to feel guilt and shame in having moved forward without consideration for their former spouse<r c="1 co 7 10 11"><span class="citation" data-cites="1_Corinthians_7:10-11"><sup><a href="#ref-1_Corinthians_7:10-11" role="doc-biblioref">38</a></sup></span></r> — then they’re not truly confessing in a biblical sense; confession requires a recognition of the original sin, not just a request for removal of debt, only to continue trespassing without a changed heart. It may seem to one with the spirit that confession, forgiveness, and repentance are all intertwined — because they are — but the heart is wicked and deceitful in all things<r c="je 17 9"><span class="citation" data-cites="Jeremiah_17:9"><sup><a href="#ref-Jeremiah_17:9" role="doc-biblioref">39</a></sup></span></r>, and will attempt to pervert forgiveness for its benefit, as is the case in this scenario where forgiveness is sought after without true confession and repentance. To clarify, I’m saying that in this scenario, the person may be using the word forgiveness improperly due to ignorance and/or selfishness, and may not be admitting that they sinned; they may be asking for the removal of the continual shame that comes from others’ judgment against their sin. By asking for “forgiveness as a blessing”, they may simply be asking something akin to, “Will you simply agree to not hold this sin against me anymore out of the kindness of your heart, even though I won’t admit I was wrong, so that I can stop feeling judgment against me?”. In this example, I think asking for an explicit confession, and confirming that their intent is to not do the same to their current spouse would be a good idea. God’s forgiveness is just, and those who attempt to have their debts removed without confessing to their sin are missing its purpose. God’s forgiveness is not only so that we can feel a lack of guilt; in fact, He requires confession because we must feel guilt. To confess, we must recognize how we have trespassed against Him and damaged our relationship with Him. Sin is not glossed over, with the effects ignored, so that the sinner can feel better about themselves. Truly recognizing our sin so that we can confess to it requires the understanding that we are guilty, cannot pay our debt, and are doomed without His forgiveness. Yet God forgives us when we confess because He is good and glorious in His grace and mercy; let us rejoice in this, and reflect it.</p>
<!-- [Examining Acts 2:38](../examiningActs2_38/examiningActs2_38.qmd) is also important in understanding repentance and forgiveness since its interpretations become quite complex and often influence theology. Understanding this discussion more fully also shows how important it is to not cherry pick theology from one verse out of context, especially without understanding the proper definitions of the words used. -->
