<section id="why-christianity" class="level1">
<h1>Why Christianity?</h1>
<p> Why should we believe Christianity over the plethora of other religions, or even atheism? Many believe the most rational position to hold on worldview is believing in nothing by default. However, if we have compelling evidence to the contrary, suggesting that there is a God, and that it’s the Christian God, then it would be made obvious that those assumptions hold their own form of faith and bias.</p>
<p> No matter what we believe, we collectively struggle to answer questions of worldview about where we came from, why we’re here, how we should behave while we’re here, and what happens when we die. Why do we have these questions? Because we can’t directly observe the origin of the universe. Because only the creator of the universe could tell us why we are here. Because only a perfect one could give us non-relativistic morality. Because no one can report back their experience of death after experiencing it. So, we have a multitude of explanations for worldview, and we must ask which answers to those questions are correct. Fortunately, the Christian God has provided evidence far beyond any reasonable doubt of His existence, and has proven that Christian scripture is inspired by Him. I think we can verify this by examining biblical prophecy, biblical history, and eyewitness testimony.</p>
<p> Why do I choose these topics? History, supported by archaeology and historical documentation (by secular and non-secular historians), agrees with the Biblical accounts. History also records the details of the fulfillment of biblical prophecy, and eyewitness testimony confirms this fulfillment. What you end up with are overlapping proofs. So, certain biblical events are historically recorded, even outside of the bible, while they also fulfill biblical prophecy, and are confirmed by eyewitnesses (even unto their death which was caused by their faith) to have happened. I hope the significance of this is apparent. An attack on one of these points leaves the other two still standing in defense of it. If an attack comes against the eyewitness testimony of the death and resurrection of Christ, for example, His historical fulfillment of prophecy still supports His divinity, and history confirms His death on the cross and that the tomb was found empty.</p>
<section id="the-overlap-with-jesus" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-overlap-with-jesus">The overlap with Jesus</h2>
<p> Before continuing, I’d like to specifically point out the prophetic, historical, and testimonial details that apply to Jesus, which I’ll also provide evidence for in this article. Prophecy foretold of the coming Messiah’s (savior’s) life, death, and resurrection; Jesus fulfilled these prophecies. Jesus’s life, and death, and the tomb being empty after His death are all supported by historical documentation. The Gospels, written by four of the twelve disciples, record corresponding accounts of their experiences with the living Jesus, and about His death, and they explain that the twelve disciples claim to have seen Jesus risen from the dead. We know that eleven of these twelve eyewitnesses claimed this even unto their own murders. Hopefully the significance of this overlap between the prophecy, history, and eyewitness testimony unto martyrdom is clear, which is that they lend to the credibility of each other so that each topic can’t be discounted without disproving the other two. While each of the topics can stand on its own, they’re also able to defend each other. I believe these topics were intentionally laid out by God for us to discover, just as he caused Jesus to become our redeeming sacrifice, so that we can have a proper undeniable evangelistic message in order to lead others to faith.</p>
</section>
<section id="biblical-history" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="biblical-history">Biblical History</h2>
<p> The Bible accurately records history. Many historical figures are recorded in the Old Testament and New Testament<span class="citation" data-cites="usefulcharts_37_2023 usefulcharts_28_2023"><sup><a href="#ref-usefulcharts_37_2023" role="doc-biblioref">1</a>,<a href="#ref-usefulcharts_28_2023" role="doc-biblioref">2</a></sup></span>. No point of secular history has contradicted its historical claims, and many points of contention have been disproved. There are many examples, but one is Belshazzar, who was recorded in the Bible, but was claimed to have been fabricated, until the Nabonidus Cylinder was found, confirming his historical existence<span class="citation" data-cites="mike_winger_defending_2016 jmclatchie_authenticity_2021"><sup><a href="#ref-mike_winger_defending_2016" role="doc-biblioref">3</a>,<a href="#ref-jmclatchie_authenticity_2021" role="doc-biblioref">4</a></sup></span>.</p>
<p> Some have even disputed the existence of Jesus. However, several historians recorded details about Jesus that fit the Bible. The Annals of Tacitus confirm that he knew Jesus was crucified under Pontius Pilate, as the Bible describes. Flavius Josephus, a Jewish historian, also confirms the same, as does Celcus, a Greek philosopher and opponent of Christianity. Thallus, and Phlegon van Tralles were both historians who mention the darkness that occurred at Jesus’s death<span class="citation" data-cites="versebyversebt_is_2010"><sup><a href="#ref-versebyversebt_is_2010" role="doc-biblioref">5</a></sup></span>. Julius Africanus disputes Thallus’s explanation for the darkness which was that it was caused by an eclipse. Since Jesus was crucified on the day of preparation for Passover, and the Passover celebration is based on the lunar calendar which the Jews followed, the timing dictated that the moon was in a position that couldn’t have caused an eclipse; it would’ve been on the opposite side of the Earth. The earthquake that was recorded to have caused temple damage in 33 A.D. could explain how the veil was torn as well<span class="citation" data-cites="cris_putnam_earthquake_2011"><sup><a href="#ref-cris_putnam_earthquake_2011" role="doc-biblioref">6</a></sup></span>.</p>
<!-- That the time of Jesus death (look for verification Mike talks about that the date of his death was historically recorded) was according to the lunar calendar of the passover, a denial that an eclipse was possible. -->
<p> The Bible records that the Jewish claim made to counter Christianity was that the disciples stole the body of Jesus; this claim is documented by the Jewish Talmud<span class="citation" data-cites="mike_winger_evidence_2016"><sup><a href="#ref-mike_winger_evidence_2016" role="doc-biblioref">7</a></sup></span>, and Justin Martyr in his debate with the Jews on the subject<span class="citation" data-cites="mike_winger_bunch_2019"><sup><a href="#ref-mike_winger_bunch_2019" role="doc-biblioref">8</a></sup></span>. This claim by the Jews concedes that the Tomb was indeed empty, and it’s still often claimed to this day. The emptiness of the tomb requires an explanation, but no good explanation has been given aside from Jesus’s resurrection<span class="citation" data-cites="mike_winger_evidence_2016-1"><sup><a href="#ref-mike_winger_evidence_2016-1" role="doc-biblioref">9</a></sup></span>.</p>

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Xil20H9yPE
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6uWSoxG_Fs -->
<p> There’s other support for biblical history, such as undesigned coincidences. Charles Leslie’s framework suggests that Jewish history, and Jesus’s resurrection celebrations set up ongoing tradition based on public events that couldn’t have been made up later. You wouldn’t convince the Jews that their history is fake, because they have a record of their history and the continued occasions made to remember them<span class="citation" data-cites="testify_can_2024"><sup><a href="#ref-testify_can_2024" role="doc-biblioref">10</a></sup></span>.</p>
</section>
<section id="eyewitness-testimony" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="eyewitness-testimony">Eyewitness testimony</h2>
<p> Jesus’s disciples were eyewitnesses of Jesus’s death and resurrection. They would’ve known whether they had made up this story, and surely wouldn’t have died for it if it were a lie. However, church history supports that they were tortured, as the Bible claims, and we’re told by the early church that eleven of the twelve were killed for their faith, with the other one being exiled. We also have other historical support for the martyrdom of three apostles: Peter, James, and Paul (Paul not being one of the twelve disciples)<span class="citation" data-cites="mike_winger_how_2019"><sup><a href="#ref-mike_winger_how_2019" role="doc-biblioref">11</a></sup></span>. Perhaps one person could be deemed to have been willing to die for a lie because of insanity, but the chances of eleven people dying for a lie when they certainly would have known better are essentially non-existent. So, we know the disciples truly believed they had seen the risen Christ. Multiple of them attested locally in Jerusalem, and soon after the time of the crucifixion, which means the claims were made in the place where and time when people would have been most likely to have the evidence to prove them wrong if it weren’t so. This is more reason to believe they weren’t crafting a fable. Luke says they saw Christ risen<r c="lk 24 31"><span class="citation" data-cites="Luke_24:31"><sup><a href="#ref-Luke_24:31" role="doc-biblioref">12</a></sup></span></r>. Paul also claims Jesus appeared to Peter, then the twelve disciples, then more than 500 people, then James, then all the apostles, before finally appearing to Paul himself<r c="1 co 15 5 8"><span class="citation" data-cites="1_Corinthians_15:5-8"><sup><a href="#ref-1_Corinthians_15:5-8" role="doc-biblioref">13</a></sup></span></r><sup>,</sup><span class="citation" data-cites="mike_winger_how_2019"><sup><a href="#ref-mike_winger_how_2019" role="doc-biblioref">11</a></sup></span>.</p>
<p> I already mentioned the empty tomb under the biblical history heading, but we also have eyewitness testimony of it. The four gospels claim that women found the tomb empty, which is unlikely to be false because women’s testimony wasn’t trusted at the time. It claims Peter and some other men<r c="lk 24 12, lk 24 24"><span class="citation" data-cites="Luke_24:12 Luke_24:24"><sup><a href="#ref-Luke_24:12" role="doc-biblioref">14</a>,<a href="#ref-Luke_24:24" role="doc-biblioref">15</a></sup></span></r> saw the empty tomb as well. Some take issue with this eyewitness testimony coming from the Bible. However, since we know the disciples were willing to give their lives for their faith, with the basis of this faith being that Christ is risen, we can have the utmost confidence that they truly believed the claim<span class="citation" data-cites="versebyversebt_is_2010 mike_winger_bunch_2019 mike_winger_evidence_2016-2"><sup><a href="#ref-versebyversebt_is_2010" role="doc-biblioref">5</a>,<a href="#ref-mike_winger_bunch_2019" role="doc-biblioref">8</a>,<a href="#ref-mike_winger_evidence_2016-2" role="doc-biblioref">16</a></sup></span>.</p>
</section>
<section id="prophecy" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="prophecy">Prophecy</h2>
<p> Some believe that the Bible’s historical prophecies were written after they happened because the events they describe have been clearly fulfilled historically. However, many prophecies in the Bible are known to have been written before they were fulfilled.</p>
<p> We have historical fulfillment of the prophecies of Tyre. This prophecy, in Ezekiel 26, explained how Tyre would fall, despite it being considered impregnable. It explained that many nations would come against it in waves, its walls and towers would be destroyed by Nebuchadnezzar, that it would be cast into the sea, being scraped flat like a rock, that fishermen would cast their nets there, and that its daughter villages would be slain by the sword; it was also noted that the city wouldn’t be rebuilt. Nebuchadnezzar’s siege, and following destruction of the mainland city proceeded as it was written. Much later, Alexander the Great eventually succeeded in building a causeway to the island city by casting the formerly destroyed mainland city into the sea. He then killed the island city residents. Since then, the area has been used for fishing. A city named “Tyre” exists near by, but the original city is still either at the bottom of the sea, or in ruins at the island, and the city, as it was, was never restored. Alexander founded Alexandria which replaced the role of Tyre. The story of Tyre’s destruction is well-documented historically, and since we know the prophecy was written before it happened, opponents often claim that the prophecy wasn’t completely accurate in some way, such as by saying a city named Tyre still exists, which I’ve already explained<span class="citation" data-cites="mike_winger_destruction_2016 david_guzik_enduring_2017"><sup><a href="#ref-mike_winger_destruction_2016" role="doc-biblioref">17</a>,<a href="#ref-david_guzik_enduring_2017" role="doc-biblioref">18</a></sup></span>.</p>
<!-- We also have the prophecy of Cyrus. -->
<!-- Prophecy of Daniel - kingdoms of the statue of 4 metals, their fulfillment, Josephus's recognition of this fulfillment. -->
<p> We have the prophecy of Daniel 7 and 8. In this prophecy, Daniel shares a prophetic dream about four beasts, which represented four kingdoms and the events that would occur in them, which came to pass over the course of several hundred years. The dates of the fulfillment of these prophecies are confirmed (by the dead sea scrolls) to be before many of the events happened<span class="citation" data-cites="mike_winger_fulfilled_2016 mike_winger_defending_2016-1 jmclatchie_authenticity_2021"><sup><a href="#ref-jmclatchie_authenticity_2021" role="doc-biblioref">4</a>,<a href="#ref-mike_winger_fulfilled_2016" role="doc-biblioref">19</a>,<a href="#ref-mike_winger_defending_2016-1" role="doc-biblioref">20</a></sup></span>. The timing of the Messiah’s coming is predicted in Daniel 9. Jesus mentions it and how he would fulfill the prophecy about the son of man by being “cut off”, and also confirms that the Jewish temple would be destroyed after this, which we know happened in 70 A.D. We know these things happened in the specific years they were predicted to happen in by Daniel, and it’s clear that this was written well before Christ was born<span class="citation" data-cites="mike_winger_daniel_2016 jmclatchie_authenticity_2021"><sup><a href="#ref-jmclatchie_authenticity_2021" role="doc-biblioref">4</a>,<a href="#ref-mike_winger_daniel_2016" role="doc-biblioref">21</a></sup></span>.</p>
<p> The Messiah was prophesied of in Psalm 22, which was written well before he was born<span class="citation" data-cites="mike_winger_really_2019"><sup><a href="#ref-mike_winger_really_2019" role="doc-biblioref">22</a></sup></span>. Psalm 22 gives 16 points of correspondence in prophecy of the crucifixion of Christ. It should be noted that Christ, while on the cross, quoted the beginning of Psalm 22, which is the passage describing His crucifixion. It’s also unlikely that this quote could’ve been made up, because the eyewitness testimony is already explaining what we know to have happened historically — that Christ died on the cross. The point is: we know the prophecy already existed in Psalm, and that Christ fulfilled it historically, so there’s no reason for Christ’s quote to have been fabricated. This is a slight edit of a list from Mike Winger which describes the points of correspondence between Psalm 22 and the crucifixion of Christ<span class="citation" data-cites="mike_winger_really_2019"><sup><a href="#ref-mike_winger_really_2019" role="doc-biblioref">22</a></sup></span>:</p>

Eyewitness testimony, unto martyrdom, is even more support that Jesus was crucified.

I’ve already written about this prophecy in <a href="../../posts/oldTestamentSalvation/oldTestamentSalvation.html#the-blessing-of-many-nations-a-sprinkling-from-christ">Old Testament Salvation - The blessing of many nations, a sprinkling from Christ</a>. <!--Prophecies fulfilled about Israel - that they would separate and rejoin; they rejoined as an official nation in 1948 after how long? --></p>
